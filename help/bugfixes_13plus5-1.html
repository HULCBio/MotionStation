          <H3><A NAME="Coverage+report+used+unsupported+HTML+characters"></A>Coverage report used unsupported HTML characters</H3>
          <blockquote>Model coverage report for Simulink 5.0 (Release 13) models using a Switch 
block 
used some characters that the MATLAB internal Help browser did not 
support. These characters (the "greater than or equal to" character and 
the "less than or equal to" character) displayed incorrectly with 
inconsistent behavior. They have been replaced by the expressions &gt;= and &lt;=.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Coverage+tool+asserted+when+condition+coverage+not+enabled+for+model+using+Fcn+block"></A>Coverage tool asserted when condition coverage not enabled for model using Fcn block</H3>
          <blockquote>When an Fcn block was included in a Simulink 5.0 (Release 13) model and 
that model 
had only decision coverage enabled (condition coverage is not enabled), 
the coverage tool asserted when condition coverage was invoked for 
internal use. This internal logic has been corrected.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Cumulative+report+summary+data+was+taken+from+delta+column+instead+of+total+column"></A>Cumulative report summary data was taken from delta column instead of total column</H3>
          <blockquote>Within the coverage report each object in the model hierarchy has a 
summary table with the coverage for the object and its decendents. This 
table should contain the coverage totals but in the cumulative report 
the summary information was being captured from the "delta" or middle 
column of coverage numbers.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Extended+Switch+block+semantics+no+longer+causes+a+segmentation+violation"></A>Extended Switch block semantics no longer causes a segmentation violation</H3>
          <blockquote>Specifying model coverage for a Simulink 5.0 (Release 13) model that used 
a Switch block with the block parameter Criteria for passing first input 
set to <code>u2 ~= 0</code> received a segmentation violation. This 
problem was due to extended Switch block semantics that were not 
incorporated into the coverage tool. This has been fixed</blockquote>

          <H3><A NAME="Code+generation+in+presence+of+junctions+in+cycles+no+longer+asserts"></A>Code generation in presence of junctions in cycles no longer asserts</H3>
          <blockquote>Code generation no longer causes assertion errors for charts containing 
flow graphs 
with junctions that belong to a cycle and are preceded by an incoming 
transition with a transition action.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Code+generation+when+an+address+is+passed+to+a+custom+C-function"></A>Code generation when an address is passed to a custom C-function</H3>
          <blockquote>Stateflow code generation no longer causes assertion failures when the 
chart 
contains a call to a custom C-function passing in the address of an 
output data, as in the example, <code>data = mycustomfcn(&outData);</code>.

          <blockquote>The Stateflow diagram editor no longer causes a segmentation violation 
when 
intersecting grouped states are ungrouped.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Output+state+activity+compilation+for+custom+targets"></A>Output state activity compilation for custom targets</H3>
          <blockquote>Generated code for a chart containing output state activity (state output 
data) for custom targets no longer has extraneous <code>#define</code>s, 
which caused it to fail to compile. Such code now compiles.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Simulation+pause+button+now+pauses+SF+chart+execution"></A>Simulation pause button now pauses SF chart execution</H3>
          <blockquote>Using the Simulation Pause button did not pause simulation when the 
Stateflow chart was executing a flow-graph. It now pauses simulation and 
brings up the Stateflow Debugger. </blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Stateflow+action+language+now+supports+context+sensitive+integers"></A>Stateflow action language now supports context sensitive integers</H3>
          <blockquote>Context-sensitive constants required a decimal point, for example, "7.0c". 
This gave users of integer-only models the impression that they were 
adding floating point numbers to their models. Stateflow now accepts 
integer context-sensitive constants, for example, "7c", and renders them  
just like just like their apparent floating point equivalent, for 
example, "7.0c".</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Stateflow+now+regenerates+code+for+a+change+in+wordsize+specification"></A>Stateflow now regenerates code for a change in wordsize specification</H3>
          <blockquote>Stateflow incremental code generation now reacts to a change in 
Production Hardware word sizes (specified in the <b>Simulink Simulation 
Parameters</b> dialog), thus avoiding the erroneous simulation results 
that occurred previously.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Stateflow+parser+allows+the+use+of+vectors+in+conditions"></A>Stateflow parser allows the use of vectors in conditions</H3>
          <blockquote>Stateflow parser allows the use of vector data in 
transition conditions. Previously, Stateflow disallowed the use of vector 
data in transition conditions, even though the vector data was being 
passed to a function returning a scalar.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Undo+operation+now+restores+the+data+types+of+graphical+function+inputs+and+outputs"></A>Undo operation now restores the data types of graphical function inputs and outputs</H3>
          <blockquote>An Undo operation after the modification of input and output data in a 
graphical function signature in Stateflow Explorer now restores the 
data types of the original input and output data of the graphical function.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Using+Undo+and+Redo+operations+after+deleting+a+graphical+function"></A>Using Undo and Redo operations after deleting a graphical function</H3>
          <blockquote>Stateflow chart editor no longer causes a segmentation violation when Undo 
and Redo 
operations are used repeatedly in combination after deleting a graphical 
function containing input and output data.</blockquote>

errors in 
chart editing.</blockquote>
