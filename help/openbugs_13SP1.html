during 
code generation. The error comes from a problem in the DSP/BIOS header 
file 
inclusion at the top of the source file <code>model.h</code>.  Preprocessor
conditionals prevent the inclusion of sts.h in this file.

<code>string.h</code>, <code>std.h</code>, <code>clk.h</code>,
and <code>sts.h</code> down below the subsequent <code>#endif</code>

          <blockquote>When you profile models that contain triggered or constant subsystems, you 
may encounter an error during TLC. Subsystem timing is not handled 
properly by the code generation engine in Embedded Target for TI C6000 DSP. 
<br><br>
In detail, when you create an atomic subsystem that is contained within a 
larger atomic subsystem, and the larger subsystem is driven by a FOR 
iterator, 
the smaller included subssystem causes an error during code generation. 
Similarly, when
you create a subsystem that is driven by a constant signal, the subsystem 
causes an error.<br><br>

than 32767 elements.  Although there is no known problem with vector sizes
up to 2^32, the function prototypes for these functions cite "short" as the

          <blockquote>When you modify a source file such that you change the line position of a 
function, creating an object to access the function can cause 
<code>createobj</code> to 
fetch an incorrect string as the function declaration.<br><br> 

This happens because MATLAB, in the process of creating a function object,
goes to the source file and extracts the declaration string from the line 
where the function definition was before your changes. CCS only updates 
the function line location when you compile and load your program on the 
target. Therefore, changing the file without recompiling and reloading can 
result in <code>createobj</code> returning an incorrect function 
declaration string.<br><br>

To avoid getting the wrong declaration string, recompile and reload your 
project after you make changes to your source code.<br><br>

To avoid recompiling and reloading, you can pass the correct 
function declaration to MATLAB using the <code>declare</code> method.</blockquote>

run your DSP, the compiler uses the original value of the variable.

This problem happens only with local variables. When you write to the local 
variable via the Code Composer Studio Watch Window or via a MATLAB object, 
you are writing into the variable's absolute location (register or address 
in memory). However, within the function, the compiler sometimes saves the 
local variable's values in an intermediate location, such as another 
register or to the stack. That intermediate location cannot be determined 
or changed/updated with a new value during execution. Thus the compiler 
uses the old, unchanged variable value.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>Register variables are often hard to figure out because the registers 
that hold the variables are not dedicated to storing just the variable
value. Digital signal processors use registers as temporary storage 
locations anytime during execution. When this occurs, the executing 
program 
stores the value of the variable somewhere in the stack and returns it to 
the register later.<br><br>

Hence, getting the values of register variables during intermediate times 
may give unexpected values. Likewise, values that you write to register 
variables during intermediate times may not get reflected.<br><br>

<b>Note--This is true for any local variable.</b><br><br>

One way to test this is to write a line of code that uses the 
variable and see if the result remains consistent.<br><br> 

Example:<br> 
 <code>register int a = 100;<br>
 int b;<br>
 ...<br>
 b = a + 2;</code><br><br>

Reading the register assigned to <code>a</code> probably returns the 
correct 
result but if <code>b</code> 
gives the expected 102 sum, nothing is wrong with your code or the link. 
In 
this case the register is behaving as it should.

To cause an executing RSIM to timeout after <code>n</code> seconds, use the <code>-L</code> command line option followed by <code>n</code>. For example, suppose you created an RSIM executable for the vdp demo; you can run the executable as follows:

<code>model_private.h</code>. The diagram of file inclusions in Figure 2-
12 on page 2-50 is correct, however.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>When code is generated for the Look-Up Table 2-D or Look-Up Table 1-D 
block for floating-point parameters with binary search, extrapolation, and 
linear interpolation selected, the number and position of repeated zeros 
is generated explicitly into the generated code. If the breakpoint 
parameters are then tuned in the real-time code during execution and the 
number or position of repeated zeros changes, the generated code will in 
most cases get an incorrect answer when the input for that breakpoint set 
is near zero.

<p>The workaround is to avoid this problem, do not change the number or 
position of reapated zeros in breakpoint parameters for the Look-Up Table 
1-D and Look-Up Table 2-D blocks.

          <blockquote>Under <B>Compiler Options</B> on page 9-45 of the Real-Time Workshop Users Guide for Version 5, the following tip is given: "If you do not require double precision for your application, define <code>real_T</code> as float in your template make file, or you can simply specify <code>-DREAL_T=float </code> after make_rtw in the Make command field."
<P>
This documentation is not correct. Various circumstances (such as the presence of literal constants) can cause this strategy to fail to remove all doubles from the generated code. The only reliable way to be sure that doubles are absent is to formally propagate single-precision signals in the Simulink model.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>Change in tlc invocation, providing full path to model file rather than 
relative path, creates backwards incompatibility in some custom targets.

When migrating Release 13 targets to Release 14, their use of TLC's TLCFILES to 
determine context, such as the path to the model file, may be affected by 
this change.
