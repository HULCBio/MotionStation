<p>The <strong>Advanced</strong> criteria panel allows you to specify a set of as many as seven properties that an object must have to satisfy your search request.</p>

<p>To specify a property, type its name in one of the cells in the <strong>Property</strong> column of the <strong>Advanced</strong> panel or select the property from the cell's drop-down property list. To display the list, select the down arrow button next to the cell. Next enter the value of the property in the <strong>Value</strong> column next to the property name. When you enter a property name, the <strong>Finder</strong> checks the check box next to the property name in the <strong>Select</strong> column. This indicates that the property is to be included in the search. If you want to exclude the property, uncheck the checkbox.<p>
