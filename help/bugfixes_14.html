          <H3><A NAME="Block+I%2FO+Optimization"></A>Block I/O Optimization</H3>
          <blockquote><p>In previous releases, there was an inefficiency where sometimes block 
outputs were incorrectly defined as global rather than local. The code ran 
slower than necessary, but there were no inaccuracies or noticeable flaws 
as a result. This did not occur every time; it was dependent on the 
previous state of an internal register.

<p>This issue is fixed, resulting in faster code in cases that were 
previously problematic.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Code+for+Logic+Block+with+Single+Input"></A>Code for Logic Block with Single Input</H3>
          <blockquote>In Version 5.x, the code generated for a Logic block with a single 
vectorized input could needlessly occupy a superfluous <code>for</code> 
loop. This caused redundant (but still correct) computations. This problem 
has been fixed.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Code+Generation+Failure+for+Relational+Operator+Block"></A>Code Generation Failure for Relational Operator Block</H3>
          <blockquote>In Version 5.x, code generation can fail under certain conditions for the 
Relational Operator and MinMax blocks when expression folding is enabled 
and input to the Relational Operator block comes from a MinMax block. This 
has been fixed.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Code+Generation+for+Data+Store+Memory+Blocks"></A>Code Generation for Data Store Memory Blocks</H3>
          <blockquote>In Version 5.0, some models that contained Data Store Memory blocks could 
generate code that would not compile. This problem has been fixed.
</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Code+Generation+for+Wide+State+Input+Signals"></A>Code Generation for Wide State Input Signals</H3>
          <blockquote>In certain block configurations, code generation and acceleration failed 
when wide state signals were emitted to a block. This could happen, for 
example, when an exported state port from an Integrator block fed into a 
Relay block. This was a regression in Version 5.0 and has been fixed.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Code+Generation+from+a+Block+Whose+Output+Is+Connected+to+a+Subsystem+Input"></A>Code Generation from a Block Whose Output Is Connected to a Subsystem Input</H3>
          <blockquote>Previously, an error occurred when expression folding was on and 
code was generated from a model that contained a block whose output was 
connected to a subsystem input. This problem only occurred for blocks 
that had expression folding switched off in their TLC file, as was the 
case for the Delay and Data Store Read blocks. This problem has been fixed.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Custom+Data+Types+with+Constant+Sample+Time+Blocks"></A>Custom Data Types with Constant Sample Time Blocks</H3>
          <blockquote>In Version 5.x, a bug caused code generation to abort for models with 
custom data type blocks with constant sample times. The error occurred 
when the <B>Inline parameters</B> checkbox was selected. This has been 
fixed.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Discrete+States+in+a+For%2FWhile+Subsystem+Reset+Correctly"></A>Discrete States in a For/While Subsystem Reset Correctly</H3>
          <blockquote>When a block with discrete states, such as a Unit Delay block, was placed
in a For or While Iterator Subsytem, the Initial Conditions of the states 
were not being set when the subsystem was called, in code generated by 
Real-Time Workshop. This is fixed.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Include+System+Herarchy+Numbers+in+Identifier+Option"></A>Include System Herarchy Numbers in Identifier Option</H3>
          <blockquote>In Version 5.0, the <B>Include system hierarchy numbers in 
Identifier</B> option in the <B>General code appearance options</B> pane 
was having no effect on code appearance. This has been fixed, so that when 
the option is checked, identifiers include system hierarchy numbers.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Merging+Signals+from+Different+Subsystems+Now+Generates+Correct+Code"></A>Merging Signals from Different Subsystems Now Generates Correct Code</H3>
          <blockquote>In prior releases the Merge block generated an inacessible local system 
output where when its source blocks are in different functions. To resolve 
this issue buffer allocation is now called recursively when Merge block 
input signals cross system boundaries. </blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Multiport+Switch+Block+Generates+Correct+Code+for+Wide+Inputs"></A>Multiport Switch Block Generates Correct Code for Wide Inputs</H3>
          <blockquote>In earlier releases, under certain conditions a Multiport switch with a 
scalar control port input and wide vector data inputs would cause code 
generation to fail. This is fixed.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="No+Name+Clashing+of+Function-call+Arguments+of+Reusable+Subsystems+and+Global+Identifiers"></A>No Name Clashing of Function-call Arguments of Reusable Subsystems and Global Identifiers</H3>
          <blockquote>In Version 5.0, it was possible for the names of the function-call 
arguments of reusable subsystems to clash with one another, as well as 
with global identifiers. Real-Time Workshop now ensures the names of the 
arguments are unique with respect to one another and do not duplicate 
global identifiers.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="S-Function+Target+Now+Uses+Double-precision+Accuracy+for+Sample+Times+on+Inports"></A>S-Function Target Now Uses Double-precision Accuracy for Sample Times on Inports</H3>
          <blockquote>When generating an S-Function target for a model or a subsystem, prior versions of Real-Time Workshop truncated any sample times used in inports to 8 digits of accuracy. In Version 6 this limitation is removed, as the code now uses full double precision on inport sample times.</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Spaces+in+TLC+Pathnames+No+Longer+Abort+Code+Generation"></A>Spaces in TLC Pathnames No Longer Abort Code Generation</H3>
          <blockquote>In Version 5.x, if a TLC directory's pathname includes a space, Real-Time 
Workshop code generation can fail due to <code>-I</code> flags being 
parsed incorrectly. This problem has been fixed.
</blockquote>
          
          
          <H3><A NAME="Tunable+Parameters+with+%22context-sensitive%22+Data+Type"></A>Tunable Parameters with "context-sensitive" Data Type</H3>
          <blockquote><p>As part of our effort to unify our handling of floating-point and fixed-
point modeling, the way in which parameter data types are handled has been 
modified:
<ul>
<p><li>All tunable parameters with unspecified data type (i.e., data type 
is <code>double</code>) will now be treated as “context-sensitive”. That 
is, the data type used for these parameters will be determined by their 
usage in the model.
<p><li>All tunable parameters that have a non-double data type will be 
declared using the specified data type, and a run-time type cast will be 
added in the generated code as necessary.
<p><li>All inlined parameters (not tunable) will be treated as “context-
sensitive” (no change).
</ul>
<P>
<B>Backwards Compatibility:</B> It is possible that this change may create 
backwards compatibility problems, although we are not expecting these to 
be very frequent or significant.
<P>
The most likely problem case is where a tunable <CODE>double</CODE> 
parameter is used in a number of different "contexts" throughout a model. 
This is not permitted and an error message will be issued. However, it is 
worth noting that if this case were supported it would always result in 
the downcasting of parameters; the recommended solution would be for users 
to specify the parameter's data type to be something other than <CODE> 
double</CODE> in these cases regardless of this change.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>Code generation failures occurred for models containing masked 
subsystems with fixed-point parameters having either a custom storage 
class, or any storage class other than <code>Auto</code>. Such failures 
occurred when generating the parameter tuning API (see "C API for 
Parameter Tuning" in the Real-Time Workshop documentation). This problem

          <blockquote>When MAT-file logging is enabled, static data structures are
declared and used to log data. Static data is incompatible
with the 'Generate reusable code' option, because that option implies that 
the generated code must be reentrant.
  
Therefore, the ERT options 'MAT-file logging' and 'Generate reusable code' 
are no longer permitted to be selected simultaneously. If both options are 
selected, a diagnostic or error action is taken. The action taken 
(none/warning/error) is determined by the 'Reusable code error diagnostic' 
option.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>Previously, if a block connected to an input of a Merge block inport is
reduced (e.g., removed by Block Reduction optimization), a segmentation 
fault occurred during code generation. To fix this problem, blocks 
connected to the inputs of Merge blocks are no longer reduced.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>In the previous release, updating a model containing a certain type of 
block  diagram pattern could cause a memory access (SEGV) error. Patterns 
that could cause this error typically consist of an accumulator 
pattern (e.g., a two-port Sum block with a feedback through a Unit Delay 
block) connected directly or indirectly along with other inputs to a Mux 
block whose output is connected to more than one block requiring 
contiguous signal input (i.e., blocks that require that all elements
of an input signal occupy adjacent locations in memory). This release

          <blockquote>In previous releases, the addterms function created an extra
Terminator block when terminating a block with a connected action 
port, for example, a Switch Case Action subsystem. The function also 
failed to ground the unconnected inputs of Triggered subsystems with 
connected trigger ports and Enabled subsystems with connected enable

          <blockquote>In Release 5.0 and 5.0.1, either continuous or fixed-step models could 
miscount steps when start time was large and/or step size was small. After 
around 10e8
steps, major steps could be skipped or the model could freeze due to a
limitation of the timing engine. The current fix increases the threshold
for this behavior to at least 10e12 major steps or more. A complete fix
is planned for a future release of Simulink.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>In previous releases, when attempting to report an illegal rate transition 
error (for example, as a result of a model update), Simulink could crash 
or identify the wrong port as being involved in the illegal rate 
transition. This behavior occurred in multirate models with rate 
transition errors between blocks with multiple input and/or output ports. 
This release fixes the problem.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>If a port-based sample time S-function has no input ports, it was possible
to see an error message about the output port sample times being set even
though all of the input port sample times had been set. Now if the output
ports sample times are all unset, and there are no input ports, Simulink
tries to set the output port sample time instead of throwing an error.</blockquote>
