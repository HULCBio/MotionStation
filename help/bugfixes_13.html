accurate waveforms by performing FIR interpolation when upsampling.  The 
FIR filters significantly reduce the levels of any spectral copies

          <blockquote><p>The new functions <code>rsenc</code> and <code>rsdec</code> operate on 
the new Galois data type, 
which represents symbols using a decimal format.  The formats used in the 
earlier functions, <code>rsenco</code>, <code>rsencode</code>, 
<code>rsdeco</code>, and <code>rsdecode</code>, are no longer 
supported.  See "Updating Existing Reed-Solomon M-Code" in the Release 
Notes to learn how to convert your existing code data to the format used 
in the new coding functions.</p>

<p>Also, the new functions enable you to choose whether parity bits appear 
at the beginning or end of each codeword.</p></blockquote>

the last index in the table when the input value is at or above the last
breakpoint value as this is more useful than the previous behavior.  For
the Look-Up Table n-D block, this is done on an individual dimension basis.
In previous versions (Simulink 4.0 and 4.1), the index search would
deliberately return the next to last index and the n-D flat look-up would
deliberately return the next to last table value even when the input value
was at or above the last breakpoint.
