=head1 NAME

Win32::ChangeNotify - Monitor events related to files and directories

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	require Win32::ChangeNotify;

	$notify = Win32::ChangeNotify->new($Path,$WatchSubTree,$Events);
	$notify->wait or warn "Something failed: $!\n";
	# There has been a change.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows the user to use a Win32 change notification event
object from Perl.  This allows the Perl program to monitor events
relating to files and directory trees.

The C<wait> method and C<wait_all> & C<wait_any> functions are
inherited from the L<"Win32::IPC"> module.

=head2 Methods

=over 4

=item $notify = Win32::ChangeNotify->new($path, $subtree, $filter)

Constructor for a new ChangeNotification object.  C<$path> is the
directory to monitor.  If C<$subtree> is true, then all directories
under C<$path> will be monitored.  C<$filter> indicates what events
should trigger a notification.  It should be a string containing any
of the following flags (separated by whitespace and/or C<|>).

   ATTRIBUTES	Any attribute change
   DIR_NAME     Any directory name change
   FILE_NAME    Any file name change (creating/deleting/renaming)
   LAST_WRITE   Any change to a file's last write time
   SECURITY     Any security descriptor change
   SIZE         Any change in a file's size

(C<$filter> can also be an integer composed from the
C<FILE_NOTIFY_CHANGE_*> constants.)

=item $notify->close

Shut down monitoring.  You could just C<undef $notify> instead (but
C<close> works even if there are other copies of the object).  This
happens automatically when your program exits.

=item $notify->reset

Resets the ChangeNotification object after a change has been detected.
The object will become signalled again after the next change.  (It is
OK to call this immediately after C<new>, but it is not required.)

=item $notify->wait

See L<"Win32::IPC">.  Remember to call C<reset> afterwards if you want
to continue monitoring.

=back

=head2 Deprecated Functions and Methods

B<Win32::ChangeNotify> still supports the ActiveWare syntax, but its
use is deprecated.

=over 4

=item FindFirst($Obj,$PathName,$WatchSubTree,$Filter)

Use

  $Obj = Win32::ChangeNotify->new($PathName,$WatchSubTree,$Filter)

instead.

=item $obj->FindNext()

Use C<$obj-E<gt>reset> instead.

=item $obj->Close()

Use C<$obj-E<gt>close> instead.
