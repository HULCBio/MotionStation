=head1 NAME

Win32API::Net - Perl interface to the Windows NT LanManager API account management functions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Win32API::Net;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Win32API::Net provides a more complete wrapper for the account management
parts of the NT LanManager API than do other similar packages. Most of what
you can achieve with the native C++ API is possible with this package - albeit
in a more Perl like manner by using references to pass information to and
from functions.

For an understanding of the environment in which these functions operate see
L<DATA STRUCTURES>.

The following groups of functions are available:

=over 8

=item L<NET USER FUNCTIONS>

=item L<NET GROUP FUNCTIONS>

=item L<NET LOCAL GROUP FUNCTIONS>

=item L<NET GET FUNCTIONS>

=back

All functions return 0 on failure and 1 on success. Use the
C<Win32::GetLastError()> function to find out more information on why a
function failed. In addition, some functions that take a hash reference
to pass information in (e.g. C<UserAdd()>) have a last argument that will
allow more detailed information on which key/value pair was not properly
specified.

=head2 Using References

References to hashes and arrays are used throughout this package to pass
information into and out of functions.

=over 8

=item Using Hash References

Where a hash reference is required you can use anything that evaluates to a
hash reference. e.g.

	$href = \%someHash;
	UserAdd(server, 2, $hRef);

Or more directly:

	UserAdd(server, 2, \%someHash);

=item Using Array references

Array references are used in a similar manner to hash references. e.g.

	$aref = \@someArray;
	UserEnum(server, $aref);

Or more directly:

	UserEnum(server, \@someArray);

=back

Please note: Any C<*Get*()> or C<*Enum()> operation will first clear the
contents of the input hash or array being referenced.

See L<EXAMPLES> and the test.pl script for examples of usage.

=head1 DATA STRUCTURES

Most the the functions in the underlying API allow the programmer to pass
specify at runtime the amount of information that is supplied to the
function. For example, the C<NetUserGetInfo()> call allows the programmer to
specify levels of 0, 1, 2, 3 (and others). Having specified this level, the
function returns a structure that will contain different fields. For a
level C<0>, the function returns a structure that has only one field. For a
supplied level of 1, the function returns a structure with C<8> fields. The
programmer needs to know in advance what fields should be provided or will
be returned for a given level. This mechanism works very will since it
effectively overloads functions without having to use different function
prototypes. Perl provides better higher level data structures in the form
of arrays and hashes. This package uses hashes as the means to pass these
variable size structure into and out of functions.

For any function that takes a reference to a hash as input, the programmer
is expected to provide appropriate keys and corresponding values as well as
the level parameter. The called function will then takes the values out of
the supplied hash and build the approprite structure to pass to the
underlying API function.

For any function that takes a reference to a hash to recieve output, the
function will first clear any keys an corresponding values in the supplied
hash. It will call the underlying API call and will then return in the hash
any keys and values that are applicable at the requested level.

Example:

The C<UserGetInfo()> can takes a number of levels. If called with level C<0>
the supplied hash will, on return from the function, contain a single key
and value - namely B<name>/B<requested-users-name>. If called with a level
of C<1> the supplied hash will, on return from the function, contain 8 keys
and values. The returned keys are C<name, password>, C<passwordAge>,
C<priv>, C<homeDir>, C<comment>, C<flags>, C<scriptPath>. See
L<USER INFO FIELDS> for more information on what these represent.


=head1 Exports

By default, Win32API::Net exports no symbols into the callers namespace.
The following tags can be used to selectively import symbols into the
main namespace.

=over 8

=item C<:User>

Exports all symbols needed for the C<User*()> functions.
See L<NET USER FUNCTIONS>.

=item C<:Get>

Exports all symbols needed for the C<Get*()> functions.
See L<NET GET FUNCTIONS>.

=item C<:Group>

Exports all symbols needed for the C<Group*()> functions.
See L<NET GROUP FUNCTIONS>.

=item C<:LocalGroup>

Exports all symbols needed for the C<LocalGroup*()> functions.
See L<NET LOCAL GROUP FUNCTIONS>.

=back


=head1 NET USER FUNCTIONS

The C<User*()> functions operate on NT user accounts.

Administrator or Account Operator group membership is required to
successfully execute most of these functions on a remote server or on a
computer that has local security enabled. Administrator privileges are
required to add an Administrator Privilege account.  There are some
exceptions to this whereby a user can change some of their own settings
where these don't conflict with 'administrative information' (e.g. full
name).

The C<server> field can be the empty string, in which case the function
defaults to running on the local computer. If you leave this field blank
then you should ensure that you are running the function on a PDC or BDC
for your current domain. Use the support function C<GetDCName()> to find out
what the domain controller is, should you not be running this on the PDC.

All functions in this section are 'DOMAIN functions'. This means that,
for example, the C<UserGetLocalGroups()> function actually lists the
domain's local groups of which the named user is a member.

The following functions are available.


=head2 UserAdd(server, level, hash, error)

Add a new user account. The user name is taken from the C<name>-key's
value in the supplied hash.

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

The server on which to add the account.

=item C<level> - Scalar Int

Level of information provided in hash. This can be either 1, 2 or 3.
See L<USER INFO LEVELS>.

=item C<hash> - Hash Reference

The information to use to add this account. This should have all the
appropriate keys and values required for C<level>.

=item C<error> - Scalar Int

Provides information on which field in the hash was not properly specified.
See L<USER FIELD ERRORS> for more information about what values this can
take.

=back

=head2 UserChangePassword(server, user, old, new)

Changes the password for C<user>. If the policy of the machine/domain
only allows password changes if the C<user> is logged on then the C<user>
must be logged on to execute this function. With Administrator or Account
Operator privilege you can use this function to change anyone's password,
so long as you know the old password.

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

The C<server> on which to change the password.

=item C<user> - Scalar String

The name of the C<user> whose password is being changed.

=item C<old> - Scalar String

The existing password for C<user>.

=item C<new> - Scalar String

The new password for C<user>.

=back


=head2 UserDel(server, user)

Deletes the specified C<user> account. Administrator or Account Operator
privilege is required to execute this function.

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

The C<server> on which to delete the C<user>.

=item C<user> - Scalar String

The C<user> account to delete.

=back

=head2 UserEnum(server, array[, filter])

Enumerates all the accounts on server that satisfy C<filter>. Unlike the
C<NetUserEnum()> function in the API, this function does not allow you
to specify a level (internally it is hardcoded to 0). In Perl it is
trivial to implement the equivalent function (should you need it) - see
L<Example 1>.

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

The C<server> on which to enumerate the accounts satisfying C<filter>.

=item C<array> - Array Reference

The array that will hold the names of all users on C<server> whose
accounts match C<filter>.

=item C<filter> - Scalar Int (optional)

The filter to apply (see L<USER ENUM FILTER>). This argument is optional
and if not present a default of C<FILTER_NORMAL_ACCOUNT> is used.

=back

=head2 UserGetGroups(server, user, array)

Get the global groups for which C<user> is a member. It returns the group
names in C<array>. Unlike the C<NetUserGetGroups()> function in the API,
this function does not allow you to specify a level (internally is
hardcoded to 0). In Perl it is trivial to implement the equivalent function
(in the unlikely event that you might need it).

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

The C<server> from which to get the groups of which C<user> is a member.

=item C<user> - Scalar String

The C<user> whose group membership you wish to examine.

=item C<array> - Scalar String

The array that will contain the group names to which C<user> belongs.

=back

=head2 UserGetInfo(server, user, level, hash)

Returns the information at the specified C<level> for the named C<user>
in C<hash>.

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

The C<server> from which to get the requested information about C<user>.

=item C<user> - Scalar String

The C<user> whose information you want.

=item C<level> - Scalar Int

One of: 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 11 and 20. See L<USER INFO LEVELS>.

=item C<hash> - Hash Reference

The hash that will contain the keys and values for the information
requested. See L<USER INFO FIELDS> for information about which keys are
present in a given level.

=back

=head2 UserGetLocalGroups(server, user, array[, flags])

Gets the names of the local groups of which C<user> is a member. Unlike
the C<NetUserEnum()> function in the API, this function does not allow you
to specify a level. Since the underlying API restricts you to level 0 there
really isn't any need to include it...

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

The server from which to get the local groups of which C<user> is a member.

=item C<user> - Scalar String

The C<user> whose local group membership you wish to enumerate.

=item C<array> - Array Reference

The array that will hold the names of the local groups to which C<user>
belongs.

=item C<flags> - Scalar Int <em>(optional)</em>

Either C<Win32API::Net::LG_INCLUDE_INDIRECT()> or 0. if C<flags> is
omitted, the function internally uses 0. Specifying C<LG_INCLUDE_INDIRECT()>
will include in the list the names of the groups of which the C<user> is
indirectly a member (e.g. by being in a global group that is a member of a
local group).

This field can take no other values.

=back


=head2 UserModalsGet()

This function is not currently implemented.


=head2 UserModalsSet()

This function is not currently implemented.


=head2 UserSetGroups(server, user, array)

Sets the (global) group membership for C<user> to the specified groups.
Unlike the API function C<NetUserSetGroups()>, this function does not take a
C<level> parameter (mainly because this option is largely redundant).

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

The C<server> on which you wish to set the group membership for C<user>.

=item C<user> - Scalar String

The C<user> whose group membership you wish to set.

=item C<array> - Array Reference

The array containing the (global) group names to set the C<user>s
membership of.

=back

This function will fail if any of the group names specified do not exist.

=head2 UserSetInfo(server, user, level, hash, error)

Sets the info for C<user> according to the information contained in C<hash>
for C<level> (see L<USER INFO LEVELS>).

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

The C<server> on which you wish to change the info for C<user>.

=item C<user> - Scalar String

The C<user> whose info you wish to change.

=item C<level> - Scalar Int

One of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 20 (according to Microsoft documentation). In
practice, you can use all the 10xx levels as well to change most of the
individual properties of the named C<user> - although this may not be
supported in future...

=item C<hash> - Hash Reference

The hash that will contain the necessary key/value pairs required for
C<level> (see L<USER INFO LEVELS>).

=item C<error> - Scalar Int

Provides information on which field in C<hash> were not properly
specified. See L<USER FIELD ERRORS> for more information about what
values can be returned in this field.

=back

=head1 NET GROUP FUNCTIONS

The C<Group*()> functions all operate only on global groups. To modify
local groups, use the corresponding C<LocalGroup*()> functions.

Administrator or Account Operator group membership is required to
successfully execute most of these functions on a remote server or on
a computer that has local security enabled.

The C<server> field can be the empty string, in which case the function
defaults to running on the local computer. If you leave this field blank
then you should ensure that you are running the function on a PDC or BDC
for your current domain. Use the support function C<GetDCName()> to find out
what the domain controller is, should you not be running this on the PDC.

The following functions are available.


=head2 GroupAdd(server, level, hash, error)

Adds the specified group.

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

=back


=head2 GroupEnum(server, array)

Enumerates all the global groups on the server. Unlike the API call
C<NetGroupEnum()>, this function does not allow you to specify a level
(internally it is hardcoded to 0). In Perl it is trivial to implement
the equivalent function (should you need it).

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

The server on which to enumerate the (global) C<groups>.

=back

=head1 NET LOCAL GROUP FUNCTIONS

The C<LocalGroup*()> functions operate on local groups. If these
functions are run on a PDC then these functions operate on the domains
local groups.

Administrator or Account Operator group membership is required to
successfully execute most of these functions on a remote server or on a
computer that has local security enabled.

The C<server> field can be the empty string, in which case the function
defaults to running on the local computer. If you leave this field blank
then you should ensure that you are running the function on a PDC or BDC
for your current domain. Use the support function C<GetDCName()> to find
out what the domain controller is, should you not be running this on the PDC.

The following functions are available.

Provides information on which field in C<hash> wasn't properly specified.
See L<LOCAL GROUP FIELD ERRORS> for more information about what values
this can take.

=back

=head2 LocalGroupAddMember()

This function is obselete in the underlying API and has therefore not
been implemented.  Use C<LocalGroupAddMembers> instead.

=head2 LocalGroupAddMembers(server, group, array)

Adds the specified users (members) to the local group. Unlike the API
function C<NetLocalGroupAddMembers()>, this function does not allow you
to specify a level (internally it is hardcoded to 3).
This was done to simplify the implementation. To add a 'local' user, you
need only specify the C<name>. You can also specify users using the
C<DOMAIN\user> syntax.

simplify the implementation. To delete a 'local' user, you need only
specify the C<name>. You can also specify users using the C<DOMAIN\user>
syntax.

The array containing the members to delete from C<group>.

=back

=head2 LocalGroupEnum(server, array)

Enumerates all the local groups on the server. Unlike the API call
C<NetLocalGroupEnum()>, this function does not allow you to specify a
level (internally it is hardcoded to 0). In Perl it is trivial to
implement the equivalent function (should you need it).

=over 8

=item C<server> - Scalar String

=head1 USER INFO LEVELS

Most of the C<User*()> functions take a C<level> parameter. This C<level>
specifies how much detail the corresponding C<hash> should contain (or in
the case of a C<UserGet*()> function, will contain after the call). The
following C<level> descriptions provide information on what fields should
be present for a given level. See L<USER INFO FIELDS> for a description of
the fields.

=head1 USER INFO FIELDS

The following is an alphabetical listing of each possible field, together
with the data type that the field is expected to contain.

=over 8

=item C<acctExpires> - Scalar Int (UTC)

The time (as the number of seconds since 00:00:00, 1st January 1970) when
the account expires. A -1 in this field specifies that the account never
expires.

=item C<authFlags> - Scalar Int (See USER_AUTH_FLAGS).

The level of authority that this use has. The value this can take depends
on the users group membership - this value is therefore read only and
cannot be set using C<UserAdd()> or C<UserSetInfo()>. Its value can be one
of:

=back


	User belongs to group		Flag value
	---------------------		----------
	Print Operators			Win32API::Net::AF_OP_PRINT()
	Server Operators		Win32API::Net::AF_OP_SERVER()
	Account Operators		Win32API::Net::AF_OP_ACCOUNTS()

The number of times that the user has failed to logon by specifying an
incorrect password.

=item C<codePage> - Scalar Int

The code page that this user uses.

=item C<comment> - Scalar String

The comment associated with this user account. This can be any string
(apparently of any length).

=item C<countryCode> - Scalar Int

The country code that this user uses.

=item C<flags> - Scalar Int (Bitwise OR of USER_FLAGS)

The flags for this user. See L<USER FLAGS>.

=item C<fullName> - Scalar String

The users' full name.

=item C<homeDir> - Scalar String

The home directory of the user. This can be either a UNC path or an
absolute path (drive letter + path). Can be the empty string ("").

=item C<homeDirDrive> - Scalar String

The home directory drive that the users home directory is mapped to
(assuming that the specified home directory is a UNC path).

=item C<lastLogon> - Scalar Int (UTC)

The time (as the number of seconds since 00:00:00, 1st January 1970)
that the user last logged on.

=item C<lastLogoff> - Scalar Int (UTC)

The time (as the number of seconds since 00:00:00, 1st January 1970)
that the user last logged off .

=item C<logonHours> - Reference to Array of Integers (length 21 elements)

The times at which the user can logon. This should be an integer array
with 21 elements.  Each element represents an 8 hour period and each bit
represents represents an hour. Only the lower byte of each integer is
used. If this is left undefined then no restrictions are placed on the
account.

=item C<logonServer> - Scalar String

The logon server for this user. Under Windows NT, this value cannot be
set and will always have the value '\\*' when queried.

=item C<maxStorage> - Scalar Int

The current release of Windows NT does not implement disk quotas so
it is believed that the value of this key is ignored.

=item C<name> - Scalar String

The user name that this request applies to. Most of the functions take
the user name as a separate argument. In general, the user name provided
should be the same as that in the one provided in the hash.

=item C<numLogons> - Scalar Int

The number of times that the named user has successfully logged on to
this machine/domain.

=item C<parms> - Scalar String

The value of this key can be used by applications. There are none known
to to author that use it, although it could be used to hold adminitrative
information.

=item C<password> - Scalar String

The password to be set. The password is never returned in a C<UserGet()>
operation.

=item C<passwordAge> - Scalar Int (UTC)

The current age of the password (stored as the number of seconds since
00:00:00, 1st January 1970).

=item C<passwordExpired> - Scalar Int

The value of this key is used in two different ways. When queried via
C<UserGetInfo()> the return value is 0 is the password has not expired
and 1 if it has. When setting the value via C<UserAdd()> or
C<UserSetInfo()> a value of 0 indicates that the users' password has
not expired whereas a value of 1 will force the user to change their
password at the next logon.

=item C<primaryGroupId> - Scalar Int

The id of the primary group that this user belongs to. When creating
accounts with C<UserAdd()> you should use a value of 0x201.

=item C<priv> - Scalar Int (Bitwise OR of USER_PRIVILEGE_FLAGS)

The privilege level that this user has. This is never returned from a
C<UserGet()> call. See L<USER PRIVILEGE FLAGS>.

=item C<profile> - Scalar String

The profile that is associated with the named user. This can be UNC path,
a local path or undefined.

=item C<scriptPath> - Scalar String

The path to the logon script for this user. This should be specified as a
relative path and will cause the logon script to be run from (relative
location) in the logon servers export directory.

=item C<unitsPerWeek> - Scalar Int

The value of this key represents the granularity of the logonHours array.
Its use is beyond the scope of this package.

=item C<usrComment> - Scalar String

The user comment field (contrasted with the comment field ;-).

=item C<workstations> - Scalar String

A comma-separated string containing upto 8 workstation that the named
user can login to.  Setting a value for this key will then allow the
named user to login to only those computers named.

=item C<userId> - Scalar Int

The user id associated with this user This value is generated by the
system and cannot be set or changed using the C<UserAdd()> or
C<UserSetInfo()> calls.

=back



=head1 USER FLAGS

The User Manager refers to this account type as a local user account.

=item C<UF_WORKSTATION_TRUST_ACCOUNT()>

The account represents a computer account for a workstation or server in
the domain.

called in the same way as other functions. You should typically use them
like:

	$ufScript = Win32API::Net::UF_SCRIPT();

=head1 USER PRIVILEGE FLAGS

Account is an an administrative account.

=item C<USER_PRIV_GUEST()>

Account is a guest account.

=item C<USER_PRIV_USER()>

called in the same way as other functions. You should typically use them
like:

	$userPrivUser = Win32API::Net::USER_PRIV_USER();

=head1 USER ENUM FILTER

These flags are used in the C<UserEnum()> function to specify which
accounts to retrieve. It should be a bitwise OR of some (or all) of
the following.

=head1 USER FIELD ERRORS

For the C<User*()> functions that take an C<error> parameter this variable
will, on failure, contain one of the following constants. Note that the
function may fail because more than one key/value was missing from the
input hash. You will only find out about the first one that was incorrectly
specified. This is only really useful in debugging.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example shows how you can create a function in Perl that
has the same functionality as the C<NetUserEnum()> API call. The Perl
version doesn't have the level parameter so you must first use the
C<UserEnum()> function to retrieve all the account names and then iterate
through the returned array issuing C<UserGetInfo()> calls.

    sub userEnumAtLevel {
       my($server, $level, $filter) = @_;
       my(@array);
       Win32API::Net::UserEnum($server, \@array, $filter);
       for $user (@array) {
	  Win32API::Net::UserGetInfo($server, $user, $level, \%hash);
	  print "This could access all level $level settings for $user - eg fullName $hash{fullName}\n";
       }
    }
    userEnumAtLevel("", 2, 0);
