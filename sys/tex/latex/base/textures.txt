Building LaTeX for distribution with Textures

Written by Arthur Ogawa (ogawa@teleport.com).
Date:    4 July  1996
Updated: 4 April 1997

This document describes how to create a distribution kit for
runtime LaTeX for Textures. It is keyed to the file

$CTAN/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/install.txt

to which you should refer for general instructions. If you are viewing
this document in QUED/M (recommended), you will find it nicely folded
into hierarchical divisions.

REQUIREMENTS
============

LaTeX R6P1 is built with Classic Textures 1.8, or later with RAM
footprint of 6.5Mb (smaller might still be feasible; try your luck).

Given a allocation block of 2k (131Mb partition), you can expect to
need free disk space for $CTAN/tex-archive/macros/latex: 60Mb. (Space
for the /latex/contrib directory alone is 44Mb.) Additional disk space
for the development files and runtime files of about 5Mb.

Font Requirements

You should have the AMS fonts installed. Blue Sky's LaTeX2e
distribution has a minimal set of fonts for LaTeX2e. If you wish to
typeset in many languages besides English, you should also install the
EC fonts, available as:
$CTAN/tex-archive/systems/mac/textures/fonts/BitmapFonts/EC_(European_CM)_1.0
.

YOUR VERSION OF TEX
===================

I assume you are using the latest Textures (as of LaTeX R6P1, Textures 1.8 or later). 
 
HOW THE INSTALLATION WORKS
==========================



SAVING YOUR OLD VERSION OF LaTeX
================================

You should already have saved your old version of LaTeX based on information
in the Textures LaTeX2e installation guide. You can have any number of LaTeXs 
simultaneously active.

PICKING UP THE SOURCE OF LATEX
==============================

(This section is not in install.txt.) When picking up the source files
for LaTeX, you should create a mirror of CTAN

ftp://CTAN/tex-archives

thus:

fonts/
  ams/
    amsfonts/
    amslatex/
  psfonts/
    adobe/
    bh/
    textures/
    tools/
macros/
  latex/
    base/ (optional if picking up unpacked/)
    contrib/
      other/
      supported/
    doc/
    fonts/ (this is a link to fonts/latex, which is standard with Textures)
    packages/
      amslatex/
      babel/
      graphics/
      mfnfss/
      psnfss/
      tools/
    unpacked/ (optional if picking up base/)

You can pick up compressed source on CTAN and decompress locally to
save bandwidth. Be careful to not translate line terminators of any
binary files (e.g., tfm, vf, dvi, or zip) in the process. Alternative:
Textures 1.8 and later will support UNIX line terminators, so you can
pick up the files BINARY and use them without modification.

You can set the name of the latex directory to "latexRxPy" to
distinguish it from other LaTeX releases in your CTAN mirror.

I picked files up in April 1997. I concluded them to be 
Release 6 (based on the presence of the file unpacked/ltnews06.tex)
at Patchlevel 1 (from an examination of unpacked/ltpatch.ltx).

In what follows, the files in the CTAN mirror will be referred to via
their UNIX-like path names to distinguish them from files in the
Development folder. In this build, no files are created in any of
these directories (with the possible exception of creating unpacked/
from base/), and no new resources are created in any of the CTAN
files. Therefore, the runtime kit consists of files copied directly
over from CTAN and generated files (generated by Textures as part of
the build process), the latter always generated in a separate set of
folders.

BEFORE UNPACKING THE DISTRIBUTION
=================================

Create the following working directory structure (or duplicate it from
a previous release):

:LaTeX RxPy           Isolates this particular version of LaTeX
  Textures.txt        This file--update it for use in your next round of work
  :Development        Generate the runtime files, doc files, etc.
    :base             run unpack.ins (optional)
    :Documentation    Generate user-level documentation
      :fonts          PS_Fonts_NFSS (optional)
      :graphics       Graphics_Bundle (optional)
    :TeX inputs       Generate files read by LaTeX at run time
      :ÄLaTeX RxPy    hierarchical version of one in :Distribution:TeX inputs:
        color.cfg     runtime file
        graphics.cfg  runtime file
        ltxdoc.cfg    runtime file

      :ÄLaTeX RxPy    

The general strategy in what follows is to avoid altering or
unnecessarily duplicating the files in the CTAN mirror as one proceeds
with the build. To accomplish this, any file that you open in
Textures, or especially any file that you typeset in Textures, should
be a file that you create expressely for that purpose, generally
somewhere in the :Development folder. Thus, one avoids putting new
resources into the CTAN files. As a byproduct of this technique, it is
simple indeed to know which files are generated files: after
typesetting one of the install files in the :Development folder, any
new files that appear in the same folder will be generated files, and
will need to be moved (somewhere) into the ÄLaTeX RxPy folder.

As you generate the files for the distribution, you will not only move
generated files into the ÄLaTeX RxPy folder, but also leave behind
aliases of these same files; this will facilitate your understanding
of the purpose of each generated file. you can do a Find Fileä on
any file in the :TeX inputs:ÄLaTeX RxPy folder: two files will be
found, the second will be an alias of the first and will indicate (by
its location in the hierarchy) which package it belongs to.

After you complete the generation of the runtime files, you will have
a :TeX inputs:ÄLaTeX RxPy folder that is completely flat. This is
important to Textures' speed.

UNPACKING THE DISTRIBUTION
==========================

Note: If you picked up the unpacked/ directory from CTAN, you do not need to run
the (time-consuming) unpacking procedure here. 

1. To proceed, open the file in :Development:base: called unpack that
contains the single line "\input unpack.ins" and typeset under virtex.
When prompted, navigate to the file base\unpack.ins. The generated
files will all show up in the unpacked directory.

2. Move all the new files into 

:Development:TeX inputs:ÄLaTeX RxPy:base:

And create an alias of latex/base/ltpatch.ltx in this directory.

3. Save the TeX log into :Development:unpacked: for future reference

You have now created a latex/unpacked/ that will serve as a vehicle for creating
the LaTeX preformatted macro package in the next step. Any runtime files will be
found in latex/base/. 

CREATING THE LATEX FORMAT
=========================

1. From Textures, open :Distribution:TeX formats:LaTeX R6P1 (which has
a single line in it: \input latex.ltx\endinput). Make sure
Typeset:Virtex 1.8ﬂ1 is checked, then select File:Make Format. All of
the files required for the run are in the folder unpacked, an alias of
/latex/unpacked. Textures will ask you to help it find latex.ltx; once
you do so, it will find the remainder.

As part of Make Format, Textures will create an alias of LaTeX R6P1 in
its TeX formats folder and immediately add it to its list of
preformatted macro packages (under the Typeset menu). You will use
this new version of LaTeX to generate further components of the
runtime kit.

2. The generated preformatted macro package is :Distribution:TeX
formats:LaTeX RxPy, the very file you opened in Textures. Save the TeX
Log in the same file after the \endinput statement following the
suggestion in install.txt.

PUTTING THE FILES WHERE LaTeX CAN READ THEM
===========================================

1. From latex/base and latex/unpacked, move into :Distribution:TeX
inputs:ÄLaTeX RxPy all of the files specified in base/install.txt
and leave an alias to each file in Development:TeX inputs:ÄLaTeX
R5P0:base or -:unpacked, respectively.

To paraphrase those instructions, move the files: 
docstrip.tex, idx.tex, lablst.tex, latexbug.tex, nfssfont.tex,
sample2e.tex, small2e.tex, testpage.tex, 
and files matching * .cls, * .clo, * .sty, * .fd, * .def, * .cfg
from latex/(base|unpacked)/. 

Note: If you have created your own latex/unpacked/, you will find that
the *.tex files are mostly to be found in the latex/base/ directory
(with the exception of docstrip.tex) and the rest of the files are
mostly to be found in latex/unpacked/ (with the exception of
ltnews.cls, ltxguide.cls, and minimal.cls). Also in this case, most
all the files in latex/unpacked/ fall in this category, with the
exception of the *.ltx files. The latter were generated in order to
build the preformatted macro package and should be moved into the
:Distribution:TeX formats:unpacked: folder.

2. Put an alias of the folder :Distribution:TeX inputs:ÄLaTeX RxPy: into
the :Textures:TeX inputs: folder.

Note that this last step mimics that taken when the end user installs
LaTeX. Note also that when the end user wants to rebuild the
preformattted macro package, they will simply retypeset the file
:Distribution:TeX formats:LaTeX R6P1.

GETTING A WORKING LaTeX
=======================

You need do nothing further to use your new LaTeX R6P1 format.

CHECKING THAT THE INSTALLATION WORKED
=====================================

1. Open :Distribution:TeX formats:check.tex and typeset it under the
LaTeX RxPy format. For comparison, my result is pasted into that file.
 
2. Fonts: I am presently using Constantine Kahn's Textures metric
suitcases named 8r reencoding, LucidaBright psnfss metrics, and
LW35nfss metrics. These metric suitcases are required for the new
psfonts font scheme, which appears to replace packages/psnfss.

Note that in his own instructions, Kahn specifies adding resources to
Edmetrics and, by extension, to Textures. This should be done by Blue
Sky Research before this kit is distributed.

For R4P0 and later, ltcheck complains that the ec fonts aren't there.
These fonts may be obtained at
$CTAN/systems/mac/textures/BitmapFonts/EC<version number>. If you are
using the EC fonts, you may want to look at latex/base/ec.ins.

PROBLEMS
========

Please correspond with me if you have any problems: 

mailto: ogawa@teleport.com
 
CLEARING UP
===========

There is no need to do any clearing up, because the only files
included in the runtime kit are those specifically required at run
time. All of the .dtx, .fdd, etc files remain in the CTAN mirror area,
where you can process them further (for documentation) as you see fit.

You might want to systematically typeset these documentation files,
thereby creating a prepared documentation set for end-user
distribution. A number of them already appear in /latex/docs; some
further doc files are:

*.ltx

begleit.err
compan.err
manual.err

ltx3info.tex

FINALLY
=======

This file is the very <system>.tex file suggested by Team LaTeX. But
it does not end here because preparing a runtime kit involves
additionally creating the runtime files for LaTeX's packages.

FILES THAT HAVE BEEN CUSTOMIZED FOR THE TEXTURES RELEASE OF LATEX
=================================================================

Four files customize LaTeX2e to Textures. They are:

color.cfg
graphics.cfg
ltxdoc.cfg
texsys.cfg (I'm trying out leaving this file out.)
textures.def        

RUNTIME FILES FOR LATEX PACKAGES
================================

For each of the subdirectories under latex/packages, you carry out the
following steps. For the purposes of illustration, consider the
graphics package.

1. In the folder :Development:TeX inputs:packages:graphics, open the
file install, which has a single line: 
"\input graphics.ins".

2. Now open latex/packages/graphics/graphics.ins.
Then typeset "install" under the LaTeX RxPy format. Numerous files are
created in the same folder as "install". 

3. Close graphics.ins and "install". Save the TeX log at the end of
the file "install".

4. Move all of the generated files into :Distribution:TeX
inputs:ÄLaTeX RxPy:graphics.

5. Make aliases of those same files in :Development:TeX
inputs:ÄLaTeX RxPy:.

The same series of steps can be carried out for mfnfss, psnfss, and tools but
with the following qualifications:

babel: This package involves creating a new preformatted macro package
(with embedded hypenation patterns). Exactly which patterns are
preloaded is determined by the builder. I have not included babel in
the runtime kit because the configuration of babel depends on the
needs of the end user. Suggestions?

graphics: The build will not generate a textures.def. That file is
provided directly in CTAN/macros/latex/packages/graphics/textures.def.
Copy (or alias) that file to :Distribution:TeX inputs:ÄLaTeX
RxPy:graphics

psnfss: this package is superseded by the new
CTAN/tex-archive/fonts/psfonts macros. I have accordingly built that
package and moved the relevant files into :Distribution:TeX
inputs:ÄLaTeX RxPy. I built psfonts, lucida, and mathtime.

mfnfss: proceed as for graphics. dccr not supported by Textures
installation (no fonts).

tools: proceed as for graphics.

amslatex: simply alias the files in the packages/amslatex/inputs directory into 
:Distribution:TeX inputs:ÄLaTeX RxPy:amslatex. 

5. Put in files that customize LaTeX to the Textures environment. These are

color.cfg
graphics.cfg
ltxdoc.cfg

You can put them directly in :Distribution:TeX inputs:ÄLaTeX RxPy. The files
color.cfg ans graphics.cfg  apply to the graphics package
and the file ltxdoc.cfg applies to base/ltxdoc.ltx.

RUNTIME FILES FOR THE PSFONTS PACKAGE
=====================================

The runtime files for fonts/psfonts is incorporated into the Textures
release of LaTeX. The psfonts package supports typesetting with many
PostScript Type 1 fonts from many different font foundaries.

The files included are those in the respective tex/ directories and
consist of mainly .fd files. There used to be a clobbering problem
with the .sty files; the tools/ directory no longer contains a psnfss
subdirectory, so things have changed.

DOCUMENTATION IN TEXTURES FORMAT
================================

The DVI files in latex/docs are provided in :Distribution:Documentation:.

The installation kit for the runtime files is the :Distribution:
folder and its contents. The end user should install by creating
aliases of the contents of the TeX fonts, TeX formats, and TeX inputs
folders in the respective folders of their Textures installation.

Note in particular that this means putting an alias of ÄLaTeX RxPy
into their TeX inputs folder, *not* aliases of the *contents* of the
ÄLaTeX RxPy folder. The object is to ensure that, insofar possible,
the only aliases in the TeX inputs folder are aliases of Ä-style
folders.
