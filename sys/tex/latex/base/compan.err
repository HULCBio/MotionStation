%
% Configuration file for the errata listing of 
%
%  The LaTeX Companion
%
%
% \erratastartdate 
%
% Specifies the date from which on errata entries should be listed.
%
% The format is YYYY/MM/DD.
%
% The default below ensures that all entries are typeset.
%

\renewcommand\erratastartdate{1994/05/01}


%
% \myprinting
%
% Specifies which (revised) printing you own. For example, if you
%    have the second printing set this to 2 so that errors already
%    corrected in that printing will not appear in your errata
%    listing.
%
% The default below ensures that all entries relevant to the second
%    printing are typeset.  (first printing are not included so don't
%    try, and a third printing does not exist although some extries
%    claim they are which means i have corrected the source :-)
%
% If you really own a first printing (which is something like a
%    collectors item i'm sure :-) you will find an ascii version of
%    its errors corrected after \end{document} in the errata file.
%    
%

\renewcommand\myprinting{2}

%
% \norevisionnumbers
%
% Specifies that all page numbers in the errata are shown in the same
%    format (bold face) irregardless of whether or not they are fixed
%    in some revision. The default is to print corrected errors in
%    italic and add the revision number as a superscript.  Since the
%    Companion has only one revision which is not included in the
%    errata we turn this feature off.

\norevisionnumbers

%
% \showallerrors
%
% With this command you tell the program that all errata entries are
%    supposed to be generated. This makes \myprinting and
%    \erratastartdate basically obsolete so this isn't turned on by
%    default.

\CHAPTER{General  }

\erroronpage{i}{last line}{KSe}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Replace ``Signapore'' with ``Singapore''.

\erroronpage{iii}{copyright notice}{BDe}{1997/06/01}{}
   True copyright symbol provided by Lucida Bright should be used.

\erroronpage{xi}{}{FMi} {1997/06/01}{}
   Add a section entitled ``Using the examples'' and describe the need
   for a) |\makeatletter| ... for commands with |@| in their name, i.e.,
   something like the explanation on page 15 and b) that people have
   to watch out for the packages they need, something that might be
   explained a little earlier on in the same section.

\CHAPTER{Front matter}

\CHAPTER{Chapter 1}

\erroronpage{1}{last line}{DAr}{1997/06/01}{}
   Replace ``the \TeX{} book'' by ``The \TeX book'' (capitalized ``The'' and
      close up).
   (The same for page 23 footnote).

\erroronpage{2}{para 3}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Replace ``in the public domain'' with ``free of charge''
   as \TeX{} is copyrighted by Donald E. Knuth and *NOT* public domain.

\erroronpage{2}{para 4}{UVi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   In the book title `\TeX{} and METAFONT ...', the METAFONT logo should
   be in italic.

\erroronpage{5}{para 3, l.1}{MOs}{1997/06/01}{}
   ``LaTeX'' should be typeset ``\LaTeX''.

\erroronpage{6}{l -8 }{MOs}{1997/06/01}{}
   |Y\&Y| should by typeset |Y\&Y\@|.

\erroronpage{7}{last line}{MGo}{1997/06/01}{3}
   ``International Standards Organization'' should be
   ``International Organization for Standardization''.

\CHAPTER{Chapter 2}

\erroronpage{12}{two lines of white space}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   This is not a mistake, only a bad design (perhaps). What you see on
   this page is a looooong  caption and the line 
     ``need different logical ...''
   is the rest of the sentence that was started on the previous page.

\erroronpage{14}{l.8}{CKr}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Add missing ``be'':  ``it will \u{be} assumed to be...''.

\erroronpage{14}{}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Replace last para with:
  ``Finally, when the |\begin{document}| is reached, all global options are
   checked to see whether each of them has been used by any package; if
   not, you will get a warning message. It is usually a spelling mistake
   if your option name is never used; another possibility is the removal
   of a |\Lmcs{usepackage}| command loading a package that used this
   option.''

\erroronpage{17}{}{JSa}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Last sentence of 2.1.2 is unclear.
   MGo: Replace with:

  ``If a document is too large to process in a single run,
   it can be sub-divided into sub-parts that can be run separately.
   However, in this case, they must be processed
   \emph{in the correct sequence} to ensure that the
   cross-references and page numbers are correct.''

\erroronpage{17}{sec 2.1.3}{FMi}{1998/05/23}{}
   The |\end{filecontents}| should be on a line by itself without
   any text or spaces on either side. If this is not the case a
   warning is produced. Also mention that this environment has a star
   form which does not write any comentary into the file.

\erroronpage{18}{para 2}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   In the front matter the so-called \emph{starred form} of the
sectioning commands is normally used.

\erroronpage{20}{table 2.1}{DAr}{1997/06/01}{}
   Replace ``-1'' by ``$-1$''  (minus sign not hyphen).

\erroronpage{23}{the footnote}{UVi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   There is a spurious space between ``\TeX'' and ``book''.

\erroronpage{24}{description of ``name'' argument}{BRa}{1997/06/01}{}
   Add something like:
  ``The \emph{name} must be non-empty.  |\@startsection| internally
   calls the command \emph{name}mark with one argument to produce
   the running head if necessary, see pages 93ff. For this reason one
   has to define such a command for completely new sectioning
   commands.  Similarily, a command with two arguments (title and
   page number) and the name |\l@|\emph{name} must exist to format any
   table of contents entries properly, see pages 34ff.''

\erroronpage{25}{description of ``afterskip''}{CRo}{1997/06/01}{}
   Boundary condition is wrong.
   Replace:   ``afterskip $\geq 0$''  by  ``afterskip $> 0$''
   and
   replace:   ``afterskip $< 0$''     by  ``afterskip $\leq 0$''.
    
\erroronpage{31}{sec 2.4}{DAr}{1997/06/01}{}
   First sentence of sec 2.4 is awkward.  Sounds like the titles specify
   the page numbers!

\erroronpage{31}{Table 2.3}{GSa}{1997/06/01}{3}
   |\refname| (default ``References'') should appear in the table.

\erroronpage{35}{}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Explanation of |\addtocontents| and |addcontentsline| arguments: file
   argument contains |toc|, |lof|, or |lot| (i.e., without ``.'' in front)!

\erroronpage{35}{ }{MDa}{1997/06/01}{}
   The last example with |\addcontentsline| is set with a different font 
   for the braces than all other examples.  Very minor ``error''.

\erroronpage{36}{ }{FMi}{1997/06/01}{}
   Reword first para to make it clearer that files with arbitrary extensions
   can be used and that ``|.xmp|'' is just one example 
   (done already in German edition).

\erroronpage{37}{last line in  table 2.4}{IAN}{1997/06/01}{}
   Add missing parenthesis: 
    ``(The default definition is a small roman font.\u{)}''.

\erroronpage{37}{l.6 below Table}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   The latest versions of the package now support ``short''
   extensions for use with operating systems like DOS.

\erroronpage{41}{ }{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Remove the ``|\label{before}|'' in the example since it does not serve
   any purpose.

\erroronpage{41}{ }{JSa}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Last paragraph starting with ``|vref| will produce a |ref| only
      when...'' is ambiguous or misleading.
   MGo: Replace with:
 ``The command |\vref| is like |\ref| when reference and
 |\label| are on the same page.  If label and reference differ by
 one, |\vref| creates one of the strings: ``on the facing page,''
 ``on the preceding page,'' or ``on the following page''; the word
 ``facing'' is used when label and reference both fall onto a double
 spread.  When the difference is larger than one page, |\vref|
 produces both |\ref| and |\pageref|.''

\erroronpage{42}{footnote}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   ``flafter'' is a package not an option!

\erroronpage{43}{before: Language Support}{FMi,JAd}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Add: 
  ``If the space added by |\vpageref| turns out to be wrong, as in
               |(\vpageref[here]{ex:foo})|
   use the variant with two optional arguments and put all text up to
   the preceding blank (in this case just the open parentheses) into both
   optional arguments, ie
               |\vpageref[(here][(]{ex:foo})|.''


\CHAPTER{Chapter 3}

\erroronpage{48}{para 3}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Add the following sentence: 
  ``Note, that accented characters have to be
   surrounded by braces like this: \verb={\"a}=.''

\erroronpage{50}{para 1}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Remove this sentence ``They are optional features ...'' since
   the new version of ulem activates them automatically.

\erroronpage{50}{example}{RBa}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Replace: ``The |\USA| has 50 states.'' by ``|\GB| was unified in 1707.''

\erroronpage{53ff}{ }{PvO}{1997/06/01}{}
   An alternative to picinpar is the pickins package which provides
   sophisticated picture inclusion (with and without caption, with
   frames etc.) into a paragraph. Main drawback perhaps: the
   documentation is very good but right now only available in German.

\erroronpage{54}{l.2}{PvG}{1997/06/01}{}
   Add a right parenthesis ``)'' after ``|tabwindow|\u{)}.''.

\erroronpage{54}{last line}{DAr}{1997/06/01}{}
   Replace ``are very specific'' by ``are intricate''.

\erroronpage{61}{first example}{FMi} {1997/06/01}{3}
   Finish line with a percent:
   ``|\setlength{\rightmargin}{\leftmargin}}%|''.

\erroronpage{64}{last l.}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Replace: ``(forcing a new line)'' by
            ``followed by a forced line break''.

\erroronpage{64}{code \string\Lentrylabel}{FMi}{1998/01/10}{}
   Change the line
\begin{verbatim}
  {\makebox[0pt][l]{\textsf{#1:}}\\}}%
\end{verbatim}
to
\begin{verbatim}
  {\makebox[0pt][l]{\textsf{#1:}}\\\mbox{}}}%
\end{verbatim}
to avoid an underfull hbox message.

\erroronpage{68}{}{PvO}{1997/06/01}{3}
   ``|\verbatiminput|'' should be ``|\verbatimtabinput|'' (in the box).

\erroronpage{69}{}{PvO}{1997/06/01}{3}
   |\begin{listing}|: I find that confusing, although I guess it is just
   the way the package works. The problem is that the required
   argument is NOT the first number that you see, but the first number
   you see = req.arg+opt.arg-1. Maybe the description can include a
   warning about this.
   MGo proposes the following text:

 ``An optional argument ``step'' specifies
  the step between numbered lines (its default value is 1,
  and it corresponds to all lines being numbered), while
  the required argument ``firstline''
  is the number of the first line.
  If ``step'' is different from |1|, then the first number
  shown will be ``\emph{step}$+$\emph{firstline}$-1$,'' for instance
  if the \texttt{listing} environment is invoked by the command
  \verb!\begin{listing}[2]{3}!, each second line
  will be numbered, starting with the number $2+3-1$, i.e., $4$.''

\erroronpage{71}{figure 3.7}{PvO}{1997/06/01}{3}
   ``|\skip\footins|'' is missing in the figure.


\erroronpage{72}{l -2}{OBa}{1997/06/01}{}
   ``|\renewcommand{footnoterule}|'' should be 
   ``|\renewcommand{\footnoterule}|''.

\erroronpage{73}{l 3}{GGr}{1997/06/01}{}
   ``|\renewcommand{footnoterule}|'' should be 
   ``|\renewcommand{\footnoterule}|''.

\erroronpage{74}{l.11}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Replace ``may not match'' by ``will not match''.

\erroronpage{74}{last para of 3.4.2}{GGr,FMi}{1997/06/01}{}
   Change to:    
  ``There are three parameters to define the style of marginal notes: 
   |\marginparwidth|, |\marginparsep|, and |\marginparpush|. Their 
   default values are shown in table 4.2 on page 87.''

\erroronpage{75}{para 2}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Replace ``accumulated in memory'' by ``accumulated in the external file''.

\erroronpage{75}{para 3}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Drop ``in memory'' since the text is stored externally.

\erroronpage{80}{last two paras from 3.5.5}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Since ftnright.sty is now updated for \LaTeX2e the last two paragraphs
   can be dropped.

\erroronpage{82}{2nd paragraph after 
   boxed\texttt{\textbackslash excludeversion}}{MGo}{1997/06/01}{3}
   ``\emph{tag} is a name...'' should read ``\emph{tagname} is a name...''.

\CHAPTER{Chapter 4}

\erroronpage{87}{table 4.2}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{}
   The table shows the value for the document styles of \LaTeX\ 
   2.09. The class files of \LaTeXe\ have slightly different values:

\erroronpage{89}{l 6}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   The vpage.sty package is now available under a new name with extended

\erroronpage{89}{l.10}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Portrait and landscape should be in typewriter font since they are actual
   keywords for the optional ``orient'' argument of |\setpapersize|.

\erroronpage{92}{l.1}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}

\erroronpage{92}{l.2}{BDe}{1997/06/01}{}
   The word ``empty'' is set in a different font.

   |\footskip| might have to be increased.''.

\erroronpage{100}{}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{}
   Add a warning that |\enlargethispage| only modifies the
   main part of the page: running headers and footers stay
   unchanged. This means that it is possible to overprint
   information in the footer if the main text gets too large.

   It could be helpful to explicitly mention that one shouldn't use |\nofiles|
   together with longtable since longtable needs to write to the |aux| file.
   It would be even better if longtable would detect this problem.

MGo: add a footnote at the end of the sentence ``...table in question'':

  ``This means that the |\nofiles| command, that suppresses
   writing of all but the \texttt{dvi} and \texttt{log} files,
   should not be used together with the \texttt{longtable} package.''.


\erroronpage{122}{5.4.2., para 2, l.5 following}{DKa}{1997/06/01}{}
   With version 4 of longtable the |\setlongtables| command
   is no longer necessary. For this reason the documentation
   starting with
      ``This feature has to be activated ...''
   up to the end of page 122 can be removed.
   In addition |\setlongtables| should be removed from the table
   on page 124 and the description on page 125.

   David's suggestion for a new description:

  ``longtable breaks the table into several chunks which are typeset one
   after the other. As later chunks are only able to influence the width
   of earlier chunks by writing information to the .aux file it might
   take several \LaTeX\ runs until the column widths converge. (If
   additional runs are necessary \LaTeX\ will output a warning). Earlier
   releases of the package needed the |\setlongtables| command to trigger
   this mechanism. Starting with version~4 this works automatically.''

   Also starting with the 1996/12/01 release longtable has additional
   commands like |\pagebreak| and also distinguishes |\\| and |\\*| (which
   are the same in ordinary tabulars).

\erroronpage{124}{table 5.6}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}

  That's actually just a suggestion:
  If you take a close look at the leaders in the index, you'll find
  that they don't line up horizontally, probably because |\dotfill| uses 
  |\cleaders| instead of |\leaders|.  By defining something like
\begin{verbatim}

 \newcommand{\indexdotfill}{%
   \leaders\hbox{$\m@th
      \mkern\indexdotsep mu\hbox{.}%
      \mkern\indexdotsep mu$}\hfill}
\end{verbatim}
  (stolen from the definition of |\@dottedtocline|) in a \texttt{.sty} and a
  redefinition in the \texttt{.ist} file (the \texttt{preamble} declaration 
  might need to be placed on a single line though): 
\begin{verbatim}

   As a general comment we should remark that when nesting command

\begin{verbatim}
   \newenvironment{foo}[1]
      { ...  #1  % argument of environment foo
        \renewcommand\bar[2]{ ...
             ##1 % argument of command \bar
             #1  % argument of environment foo
             ##2 % argument of command \bar

   |\newcommand| and |\renewcommand| now support a starred form which
   makes it illegal to use |\par| (or an empty line) in the argument(s)

\erroronpage{509}{}{PvO,FMi}{1997/06/01}{}
   Reference 249 for |\left| should be 248. (This is probably true for
   other entries pointing to the example section of chapter 8, because
   index entries to the examples are placed after the example.)

\erroronpage{517}{}{OBo}{1997/06/01}{}
   Entries for ``Page header'', ``Header of page'', ``Page footer'', and
   ``Footer of page'' should also point to pages 91 and 96 and perhaps
   also to page 20 where table 2.2 describes how sectioning commands 
   relate to page headers.

\erroronpage{519}{}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   Environment supertabular is incorrectly indexed under |\supertabular|.

\erroronpage{520}{}{PvO}{1997/06/01}{}
   Reference 249 for |\right| should be 248.

\erroronpage{525-527}{}{BBe}{1997/06/01}{}
   I was a little surprised to find the listing for ``\TeX\ users group''
   where one would expect to find ``TUG'' in the index, although ``TUG''
   doesn't appear in the entry.  I also would have expected to see
   p.260 listed with that entry, considering the reference there to
   the TWGMLC and the Portland meeting.

   The people who were acknowledged in the preface don't show up in
   the index.  Although it's not necessary, of course, Knuth did
   include his acknowledgees and sources of quotes in the \TeX book
   index, so there's a precedent.

\erroronpage{526}{}{UVi}{1997/06/01}{}
   Add index entry ``Title page'' to point to 452.

\erroronpage{527}{}{FMi}{1997/06/01}{3}
   ``|\unitlength|'' is incorrectly indexed as a command.

**********************************
*                                *
*    Errors in first printing    *
*                                *
**********************************



========== General   ===========

* Some source files in the LaTeX2e distribution have got new names,
for example latex.tex -> lt....dtx (many files). The final
distribution is still under construction.


========== Front matter ===========

-* Title Page
  Drop IPS, from affiliation of Samarin (just leave ISO)

-* Copyright page
  Add second printing

-* Table of Contents, Page xviii
  10.5 should read "Packages Based on epic

-* Table of Contents, Page xxi
  Page number of Bibliography should be 481

-* Table of Contents, Page xxiii
  5.8 A comparison (not A Comparison)


========== Chapter 1 ===========

-* Page 3 last para (SKi)
  files containing the structures and layout definitions (extension
  .sty) should also include extension .cls

-* Page 4 (JSa)
  Add clo to LaTeX layout & structure file extensions

-* Page 5 third par (GGr)
  In Textures, the transcript file has no extension.


========== Chapter 2 ===========

-* Page 13 (PHa)
  4th bullet item:  define your own   (not OUR own)

-* Page 15 (JSa)
  1994/08/02 should also be 1994/08/01

-* Page 29 (NPo)
  fig 2.9: braces round argument `title' and `toc_entry' missing.
  (very strange this)

-* Page 37, l.6 below Table (GGr)
  Extension .mtc<N> will not work in DOS (Windows).

-* Page 44 (JSa,FMi)
  The default for \reftextfaraway was missing.
  Also changed the local adaption example to use \RequirePackage
with a reference to Appendix A.

========== Chapter 3 ===========

-* Page 48 (LLa)
  The paragraph above the example unfortunately doesn't describe the
example any longer, it describes an old version of it.

-* Page 52 (OBa)
  \fuzzy should be \fussy (3 lines above title 3.1.5...)

-* Page 52 (SKi)
  The multispace package was written by Stephen (not Stephan) Page.

-* Page 59 (FMi)
  The representation of \labelitemiv is missing. This seems to be
a``correction'' of the printer people since the dot is in the
PostScript file!

-* Page 62 (MGo)
  More general (and more correct) description of general list
parameters. Especially the relation between the \labelwidth and
\itemindent lengths are made clearer.

-* Page 65 (DCa)
  The labels in the Mentry env are aligned on the top of their *boxes*
not on their first baselines. (A buggy \parbox[t] implementation on
the way to LaTeX2e)

-* Page 67 (NPo)
  \begin{verbatimtab}[...] instead of \verbatimtab[...]  since we
describe an environment

-* Page 70 (FMi)
  verbatimwrite is incorrectly mentioned as a command but it is an
environment. Also correct index entry.

-* Page 71 (DCa)
  stepping the mpfootnote counter
should be
  stepping the footnote counter


========== Chapter 4 ===========

-* Page 86 (FMi)
  testpage.tex in LaTeX2e now asks interactively for the paper your
printer uses so there isn't any need to use testa4.tex any longer.

-* Page 94-95 (FMi)
   Replace para starting at the bottom with:
The marking commands work reasonably well for right markers ``numbered
within'' left markers (for example, when the left marker is changed by
a \Lcs{chapter} command and the right marker is changed by a
\Lcs{section} command).  However, it produces somewhat anomalous
results if a \Lcs{markboth} command is preceded by some other mark
command on the same page---see the page receiving \texttt{L5 R3.2} in
Figure~\vref{fig:pagemarkers}. This figure shows schematically which
left and right markers are generated for pages being shipped out.

-* Page 95 (FMi)
   Replace the last four lines in figure 4.3 with the following five
   lines:
\markboth{L4}{}                   {L4}{}
\markboth{L5}{}                   {L5}{}
\newpage%    ----page break ----                   L5      R3.2
\markright{R5.1}                  {L5}{R5.1}
\end{document}                                     L5      R5.1



-* Page 97 (GGr,FMi)
  Replace begin of second para with:

Some \LaTeX{} commands, like \Lcs{chapter}, use a \Lcs{thispagestyle}
command to automatically switch to the \Psty{plain} page style, thus
overriding the page style currently in effect.  To customize such
pages use the \Pmsty{fancyplain} page style.  This page style sets up
\Psty{fancy} for normal pages and in addition ...

-* Page 98 (EPi)
  \usestylefile{fancyheadings}   (in bottom example)
should be
  \usepackage{fancyheadings}

-* Page 99 (EPi)
  \usestylefile{fancyheadings}   (in figure 4.6)
should be
  \usepackage{fancyheadings}

-* Page 99 (FMi)
  \samepage is considered obsolete in LaTeX2e and will not be
documented by Leslie Lamport in his book; the relevant paragraph has
been rephrased.


========== Chapter 5 ===========

-* Page 111 (OBa)
   "substracting" should be "subtracting" (12th line from top)

-* Page 120 (DKre,FPo)
   Bring Example text and table 5.3 in synch

-* Page 121 (DKre,FPo)
   Bring Example text and table 5.4 in synch

-* Page 123 (FMi,FPo)
   Bring Example text and table 5.5 in synch

-* Page 127 (FPo)
   The bottom left figure seems to have a quote before Tsonga
This is a printing artefact.

-* Page 127 (PvO)
   Bottom left figure, there is also some spurious ink before
   Croatian.

-* Page 127 Table 5.7 (FPo)
  In the last `page' the code for Tsonga appears as 'ts, with a quote
in front of it. It might be a blob of ink, but it looks very much like
a quote. (It is a blob of extra ink, and this was missed by the
printer, compare p59.  FMi:-)

-* Page 128 (FMi)
  Lowercase word "comparison" in caption for table 5.8
  Also correct lot entry page xxiii.

-* Page 133 (MGo)
  In table 5.9 URW is misspelled as URM


========== Chapter 6 ===========

-* Page 151 (MGo)
  Figure 6.2, the vertical lines of the box surrounding the map
  are partly invisible (printing problem)


========== Chapter 7 ===========

-* Page 170 l. 9, f.b. (GGr)
  Change sentence to: Font metric files (i.e., .tfm files) are loaded
for all intermediate typefaces, even if these fonts are never used.

-* Page 171 caption (GGr)
  Change
          easy memorable
  to
          easily memorizable

-* Page 171 (FMi,LLa)
  The default for \nocorrlist was changed to
\newcommand{\nocorrlist}{,.}
  in the LaTeX distribution because :; do not look right with the
default LaTeX fonts from the Computer Modern families.

-* Page 177 (FMi,LLa)
  The example shows that \mathnormal produces italic numbers. This is
only true for the Lucida Math Fonts used in the Companion. Thus, the
following footnote should be added to the expanation:
  \footnote{With the default setup of \LaTeXe{} using Computer Modern
math fonts, \Lmcs{mathnormal} will produce old style numerals, not the
italic ones shown in the example, where Lucida is used.}

-* Page 180 in 7.5, l. 3 (GGr)
  section B should be Appendix B

-* Page 180 l. 3 f.b.  (GGr,FMi)
  `Consequentially' should be `Consequently';
   in the same sentence change `used' to `uses'.

-* Page 186 l. 8 f.b. (GGr)
   Add space before `This'

-* Page 187 last line (GGr)
   Captialize: new font selection scheme

-* Page 191 last line (FMi)
   Add: For this to work the encoding OT2 must be declared in the
preamble or a package file.

-* Page 194 (FMi)
  \cmdunh10.tfm
should be
  cmdunh10.tfm

-* Page 195, 197 (FMi)
  Again all .tfm files shouldn't have \ in front of their names

-* Page 201 (MGo)
  substract should be subtract on second line explaining \fontdimen4

-* Page 202 (FMi)
  For peamble read preamble

-* Page 204 (GGr)
  fontdef.tex was renamed to fontdef.ltx in the final distribution
  (also correct index entry)

-* Page 205, last para (SMi)
 [...], you first have make the typeface [...]
should be
 [...], you first have to make the typeface [...]

-* Page 211 (FMi)
  Warning message "Check substitution defaults for ..." was changed to
"Checking defaults for ...". Also change \DeclareFontEncoding to
\DeclareFontSubstitution in last sentence of explanation for this
message.

-* Page 211 (FMi)
  The message "Don't use ..." was changed to "Command ... invalid in
math mode".

-* Page 211 (FMi)
  The message "Encoding scheme <name> changed to <new name> in ..."
has changed to "Encoding <name> has changed to <new name> for ..."

-* Page 213 (FMi)
  New message added:

\erritem{Overwriting \m{something} in version \m{name} ...}

A declaration, like \Lcs{SetSymbolFont} or \Lcs{DeclareMathAlphabet},
has changed the assignment of font shapes to \m{something} (a symbol
font or a math alphabet) in the math version \m{name}.

-* Page 214 (FMi)
  New message added:

\erritem{Size substitutions with differences up to \m{size} have occured}

This message will appear at the end of the run in case \NFSS{}
selected at least one significantly different size because the
requested size was not available.  The \m{size} is the maximum
deviation that was needed.

-* Page 214 (FMi)
  New message added:

\erritem{Some font shapes were not available, defaults substituted}

This message will appear at the end of the run in case \NFSS{}
had to use automatic font substitution for some font shapes.


========== Chapter 8 ===========

-* Page 215 (FMi,MGo)
   Added a reference to George~Gr\"atzer's book on AmSLaTeX.
   Also add bibliography [95] (see bibliography section later)

-* Page 218 (DCa)
   \o
   should be
   o

-* Page 219 (DCa)
  `blank' \rown
      should be
   /-\    \frown   (didnt this one create a TeX error :-)
                   (FMi no because of TeX's \csname bug :-( )


-* Page 219, 222 (DRo,FMi)
  The \varnothing and \emptyset do show the wrong
character, ie need exchanging.

-* Page 220 (DCa)
  { should be \{
  } should be \}

-* Page 220, Table 8.13. (LLa)
   Is that \digamma right?  It looks an awful lot like a slanted
   F to me.
This is unfortunately true. The Lucida Fonts do not contain that
character and we overlooked that the font setup simply points to the
slanted F.

-* Page 222, Table 8.20 (FMi)
  The characters \Game \Finv \Bbbk \diagdown \diagup are now part of
amssymb.sty

-* Page 231 (DCa)
  The \biggl( in the scope of \begin{large} is *smaller* than the
normalsize one!

-* Page 238 (DCa)
  The examples of split environment with and without the ctagsplt
option do not work as the linewidth is too narrow, so in both cases
the tag apears on the line before the display.

-* Page 241 (PHa)
  The typeset equation just before (8.41') should have a tag: '
  (This is once more a printer problem. the tag ' is in the PS file
and must have been removed by somebody manually)
To avoid this problem the example was changed to show $*$ twice.

 * Page 243 (FMi)
Replace fist sentence of 8.6.5 with:
  A few options are recognized by the amsmath package and the class
  files coming with AmS-LaTeX.

-* Page 244 ... 251 (FMi)
  The vertical lines in the examples (mentioned on this page) are all
missing on the final printout. Another printing problem.

-* Page 250 (MGo)
  section 8.7.6: some space (\thinspace) should be inserted in
  front of the semicolon (;) at the end of formula 8.57 and its
  unnumbered equivalent (fourth line from bottom).

========== Chapter 9 ===========

-* Page 270 (BNa)
  8th line of example should read
  \\\today\end{center} instead of \\\today{center}

-* Pages 272 and 274 (BGa, MGo)
  Use correct (Lucida, not poor man's) guillemets
  \symb{13}, \symb{14} for French

========== Chapter 10 ===========

-* Several pages have index entries added (MGo)

-* Page 277 (LWi)
  In CTAN version of shadow.sty \shadowbox is called \shadox
  In example replace also \shadowdim by \sdim. (Unfortunately we used
  one of the many variants of this package.)

-* Page 278 (DCa)
  This is a ovalbox
should be
  This is an ovalbox

-* Page 280-281 (MGo,FMi)
  Describe new command \qbezier, and replace old bezier
  style and command with \qbezier commands in examples.

-* Page 303 (FMi)
  Change section heading 10.5 to "Packages Based on epic"
  Change also table of contents on page xviii

-* Page 305 (FMi)
  The lower picture should be turned 180 degrees.

-* Page 307 (DCa)
  A tree graph ican bedrawn
     should be
  A tree graph can be drawn

========== Chapter 11 ===========

-* Page 314 (MGo)
  Figure 11.1: some of the dotted vertical and horizontal lines
  indicating the coordinate system are part invisible
  (printing problem)

-* Page 318 (DKu)
  first line of boxed description of \epsfig command,
  rotate=angle,% should be angle=degrees,%

-* Page 321 (MGo)
  Figure 11.5 The vertical lines at the right-hand side of the
  is invisible (printing problem)

-* Page 333 (PHa)
  Footnote in Table 11.6:  ZapfChancery (not ZaptChancery)
  Tag entries for Sans Serif fonts as sl (slanted) instead
  of it (italic)  (FPo)

-* Page 333 last line (GGr)
  Change to: The mapping between the layout in a PostScript font and
the font encoding needed by TeX ...

-* Page 340 (PHa)
  6th line before the end of 11.9.7: Hyphen missing in AMS-TeX

-* Page 340 (DKra,FMi)
   para 4, line 5: ... (see tables 8.2 to 8.20 beginning in page 218)

========== Chapter 12 ===========

-* Page 359 (DCa)
  postamble command preceeding the index
     should be
  postamble command following the index

-* Page 360 (PHa)
  last line of 12.4.2: the correct page reference is 355, not 353.

========== Chapter 13 ===========

-* Page 393, middle of page (KML)
  Utah Univeristy should read Utah University

-* Page 401, 5th line from bottom (SMi}
   left braces missing in {G{\"o}}del}, should be {G{\"{o}}del}

========== Chapter 14 ===========

-* Pages 435-438 (FMi)
  By convention .dtx files are files that can be directly processed by
LaTeX (by making the `driver code' the first docstrip module)

========== Appendix A ===========

-* Page 446 (DCa)
(\stepcounter description)
  oldcr
should be
  oldctr

-* Pages 448 and 449 (MGo)
  All occurrences of the string "\cmd", representing the LaTeX
  lengths parameters should not have the \ (backslash) to
  be compatible with the syntax used in Lamport and the rest
  of the Companion (Lamport assumes that cmd implicitly implies
  the backslash).

-* Page 458, 2 para (MGo)
  innner-pos should be inner-pos

-* Page 459 (DCa, MGo)
You use `cmd' for \sbox, but `\cmd' for lrbox.
Should be 'cmd' throughout to be compatible with Lamport's syntax.

-* Page 461 (FMi)
  Add \ProvidesFile to table.
  \PassOptionsToClass{option-list}{release} should read
  \PassOptionsToClass{option-list}{class}

-* Page 462 (FMi)
  Describe \ProvidesFile. This is like \ProvidesPackage but you need
  to give the full file name including extension. It is meant for
  files that are neither packages nor classes but want to identify
  themselves too.

-* Page 467 (War)
  \PassOptionsToClass{option-list}{release} should read
  \PassOptionsToClass{option-list}{class}

-* Page 468, second line of example (DOs)
  \NeedsTeXformat{LaTeX2e} should read \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}

-* Page 474 (DCa)
  \ifodd
should be
  \isodd
also correct index entries

========== Appendix B ===========

-* Page 475 (PHa)
  line -3: where Jones' TeX-index
                      ^ (insert apostrophe)

-* Page 476 (NPo)
   - CTAN host in Germany has changed to ftp.dante.de
   - correct location of TeX-index file on ftp.dante.de (MGo)

 * Page 476 (ASc)
   The host pit-manager.mit.edu has changed its name to rtfm.mit.edu.

-* Page 479 (MGo) update for Dante
   - their mail server is at ftpmail@dante.de,
   - send a message containing the word "help" to get instructions.

-* Page 480 (EPi,MGo)
   UKTeX gets Chair instead of Chairman
   Group francophone should read Groupe francophone
   Email address for Dante is now dante@dante.de (MGo)

========== Bibliography ===========

-* Pages 482 and following (BBe)
    TUGboat should have a small "b"; occurs about a zillion times in
    both references and text. why don't you just use \TUB for it:
    \def\TUB{{\tubfont TUGboat\/}}

-* Page 482, [11] last line (BBe)
   "bowles" should be "bowls"

-* Page 485, (BBe) [31] last line (BBe)
    "Script Mathematical Formula Processor -- SMFF"
    maybe that should be "SMFP"?, No, it should be (MGo) :+{
    "Script Mathematical Formula Formatter -- SMFF"

-* Page 485, [33]--[35] (BBe)
    omit "Technical Report" from before the ISO numbers.
    the ISO document system also has technical reports, which have "TR"
    in their number designations; these are quite different from the
    standards, which is what is being referred to here.
    also in [35] you should refer to "ISO/IEC 10646, ISO Geneva, 1993."
    this was approved as a formal standard last year, so the "draft" is
    no longer appropriate.  and it's joint with the International
    Electrotechnical Commission, no longer just ISO.

-* Page 486, [37] (BBe)
