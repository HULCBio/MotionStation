                 LaTeX installation instructions for
                  VTeX/Free, version 7.30 and above

SUMMARY
=======

This file contains instructions on how to install LaTeX for VTeX/Free
version 7.30 and above.  In case you are still running an older
version, upgrading to the latest one is heavily recommended.
 
This file describes:
 
 * How to unpack the LaTeX distribution.
 
 * How to create the LaTeX format.
 
 * How to install the LaTeX files.
 
 * What to do if you have any problems.
 
The below instructions refer to VTeX/Free for Linux-x86 (VTeX/Lnx) as
well as to VTeX/Free for OS/2 (VTeX/2).  Differences are indicated,
where necessary.  Paths are always written in Unix style, i.e., using
slashes.


REQUIREMENTS
============

These installation instructions assume that you have installed the
VTeX/Free system already and want to upgrade LaTeX to a newer version.



SAVING YOUR OLD VERSION OF LaTeX
================================

Back up the contents of the directories texmf/source/latex/base and 
texmf/tex/latex/base.


UNPACKING THE DISTRIBUTION
==========================

Copy all the files from the CTAN directory macros/latex/base to the
directory texmf/source/latex/base of your VTeX system.

Open a shell or OS/2 window and make the above directory the current
one.  Then unpack the distribution by executing the command:

   vtexlnx -i unpack.ins  (Linux)
or
   vtex -i unpack.ins     (OS/2)

NB:  If you are still using version 7.3x of VTeX/Lnx, the full path of
the vtexlnx executable, usually /usr/local/vtex/bin/vtexlnx, is to be 
specified!


PUTTING THE FILES WHERE LaTeX CAN READ THEM
===========================================

The next step in the installation of LaTeX is to move the files needed
to run the system into the correct directories (folders).

The following files are to be moved from texmf/source/latex/base to 
the LaTeX input directory texmf/tex/latex/base:
 
 * latexbug.tex, testpage.tex, lablst.tex, idx.tex, nfssfont.tex 
   small2e.tex, sample2e.tex and docstrip.tex:
 
 * the file texsys.cfg, if it exists (this depends on your version
   of VTeX/Free)
 
and any files whose name ends with:
 
 * .cls   document class files,
 
 * .clo   document class options files,
 
 * .sty   package files,
 
 * .fd,   font definition files,
 
 * .def   files of definitions which may be read by LaTeX while
          processing documents.
 
 * .ltx,  the files from which the format can be built.
 
You should move to the MakeIndex input directory texmf/makeindex
all files whose name ends with:
 
 * .ist,  MakeIndex style files.
 
Please, note that any files existing already in the target directories
must be overwritten!

 
CREATING THE LaTeX FORMAT AND CHECKING THAT THE INSTALLATION WORKED
===================================================================

See the LaTeX Local Guide, section "Creating the format file"!


PROBLEMS
========
 
The installation should proceed smoothly.  However, you may get some
errors.

`File missing': Some of the files from the LaTeX distribution are
   missing.  There are a number of possible reasons for this:
 
   * The files really are missing.
     You should get the missing files from the same place you got the
     rest of the distribution.  If you cannot do this then you should
     complain to whoever gave you this distribution.
 
   * The files are present, but in the wrong directory.  See the
     section above "Putting the files where LaTeX can read them"
 
   * The files are present, and in the right directory.  Check the
     path setttings in the main configuration file (vtex.ini or
     vtexlnx.rc, resp.).
 
`Font missing':  Some of the fonts (.tfm and/or .pfb files) required
   by LaTeX are missing.  As above, either you have not got the
   required files, they have been deleted, or TeX is not able to find
   them.  Check the main configuration file and the files
   texmf/vtex/config/pdf.fm and texmf/vtex/config/ps.fm.


If you have any problems installing LaTeX, you should:
 
 * consult the LaTeX Local Guide and the VTeX/Free manual;
 
 * if this fails, try asking the ntg-vtex mailing list or a general
   TeX mailing list.
 

CLEARING UP
===========

You may now be wondering what to do with all the remaining files in
the directory texmf/source/latex/base that are not needed to run
LaTeX.  This is, of course, a matter of personal taste and
availability of disk space but here is some guidance.
 
 * The files ltnews<xx>.tex contain the LaTeX newsletters.  You should
   run the latest one through LaTeX and nove the resulting PDF file to
   the directory texmf/doc/latex/base

 * The files with names of the form <xxx>guide.tex contain reference
   information covering (amongst other things) those features new to
   this version of LaTeX:  they are not intended to be either a user
   guide or a complete reference for the system.  You should run them
   through LaTeX and move the resulting PDF files to the directory 
   texmf/doc/latex/base, thus replacing the previous versions.

 * The files with extension .dtx, together with source2e.tex,
   can be used to typeset the documented source code (see texpert.txt
   for further information).

 * The files with extension .fdd contain the documented sources for
   the font definition files. 

 * The file ltx3info.tex contains information about the LaTeX3 project
   and how you can support it.
 
 * The files with extension .txt contain information about (amongst
   other things) copyright, installation, patches and bug-reports; and
   those with extension .err contain errata lists for various
   publications: see 00readme.txt for further details. 

 * The file ltxcheck.tex is used to test the format; therefore you
   should keep it if you expect to remake the format before getting
   the next full distribution.

 * The files with extension .ins are used to unpack the code from the
   .dtx and .fdd files.

 * We recommend that you keep, in the formats directory vtex/fmt, the
   transcript file that was produced whilst creating the format; this
   file is named latex.log.
