WELCOME TO LaTeX!

This file contains a brief distribution guide for the new standard
version of the LaTeX document preparation system.

This system is maintained by The LaTeX3 Project Team.

      ********************************************************
      * Please read this file carefully because it gives     *
      * important information about other documentation      *
      * provided with the LaTeX system that will help you    * 
      * in installing and using it.                          *
      ********************************************************

      ********************************************************
      * The files ltnews15.tex and ltnews15.ps both contain  *
      * the latest LaTeX newsletter.                         *
      *                                                      *
      * Please print it and distribute it to all users ...   *
      * and to anyone else who may be interested.            *

      * It fits onto a single sheet, so it can be displayed  *
      * as a poster.                                         *

The LaTeX system is described in:

 * LaTeX: A Document Preparation System; Leslie Lamport, Addison-Wesley

 * The LaTeX Companion, Goossens; Mittelbach and Samarin, Addison-Wesley


This distribution is described in the files ending with .txt.  You
should read install.txt before starting to install LaTeX.

Here is a brief description of some of these files:

 * 00readme.txt is this file.

 * manifest.txt lists all the files in the LaTeX distribution
   with one line information about their contents.

 * install.txt describes how to install LaTeX.

 * tex2.txt contains important information for users of old versions
   of TeX (pre 1990).

 * autoload.txt contains important information for users of older
   computers with limited memory. 

 * unpacked.txt lists all the files in the unpacked LaTeX distribution.

 * legal.txt and lppl.txt describe the LaTeX copyright, warranty and
   copying restrictions.

 * patches.txt describes the update policy and how important changes
   will be distributed between release dates.
 
 * texpert.txt contains information about the installation that is
   useful for TeX experts.
 

 * bugs.txt describes how to submit a bug report for LaTeX.


Other documentation files include files with names of the form:

   <xxx>guide.tex

You will probably need to update your system before you can typeset
these files.  Each file needs three LaTeX runs.


The following files also contain useful information:

 * ltx3info.tex gives you some information about the LaTeX3 project.

 * the other files ltnews##.tex are the news files from previous
   releases: these contain useful information but be warned that some
   of it may be out-of-date as these files are never up-dated.

 * manual.err lists errata in:

you rename them, *except* for certain files such as the configuration
files, ending with .cfg.
