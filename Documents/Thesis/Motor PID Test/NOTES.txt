ramp P10 I0,5 100N
Kc=10 Ti=0.5 did not correct for offset in sufficient time. thus, I was Ti was decreased (increasing Ki).

triceps Kc=10 or 12 , Ti=0.5

brachialis Kc=7, Ti=0.5

dt=0.012


I know for sure:
1. must tune muscle force PIDs while moving passively.
2. Kc values must be much higher while moving than when arm is still. Requires tendon excursion to get good values for motion.
3. need much smaller values when arm is still to avoid bouncing.
