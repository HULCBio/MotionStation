This directory contains examples of the MATLAB API.

The mex/ directory contains example MEX-files.  It includes the
examples mentioned in the MATLAB API Guide tutorial.  It also includes
the examples in the MATLAB API reference pages for mex interface
functions (the functions beginning with the mex prefix).

The mx/ directory contains examples for using the array access
functions.  Although these functions are available in standalone
programs as well, most of the examples are MEX-file examples.  The
only exception is mxSetAllocFcns.c, since this function is available
only to standalone programs.

The eng_mat/ directory contains examples for using the MATLAB Engine
facility, as well as examples for reading and writing MATLAB data
files (MAT-files).  These examples are all standalone programs.

For instructions on building the various examples in these directories
on your platform, please consult the MATLAB API Guide.
