   This file describes the rights you have for the "mwunzipsfx.exe" file.
 This file and the rights described herein, do NOT apply to the whole of, 
 or any other part of the MATLAB, SIMULINK, or toolbox programs.

   mwunzipsfx.exe, a stub used to build MS-Windows self-extracting archives, is
 used by the MATLAB for Visual Studio packager. It is provided under the terms 
 of the Info-ZIP license. This means that you are free to make and distribute 
 self-extracting archives that contain and use mwunzipsfx.exe. mwunzipsfx.exe 
 operates similarly to Info-ZIP's UnzipSFX, except that after the extraction
 stage is complete, it will automatically execute and then delete the first
 file it extracted (usually, but not necessarily, the first file in the zip
 archive).
