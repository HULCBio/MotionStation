            of some of the numerical details of fitting with custom distributions.  The <a href="customdist1demo.html">Fitting Custom Univariate Distributions</a> demo covers other examples.

      <h2>Fitting custom distributions with censored data<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>The extreme value distribution is often used to model failure times of mechanical parts, and experiments in such cases are
         sometimes only run for a fixed length of time.  If not all of the experimental units have failed within that time, then the
         data are right-censored, that is, the value of some failure times are not known exactly, but only known to be larger than
         a certain value.
      </p>
      <p>The Statistics Toolbox includes the function <tt>EVFIT</tt>, which fits an extreme value distribution to data, including data with censoring.  However, for the purposes of this example,
         we will ignore <tt>EVFIT</tt>, and demonstrate how to use <tt>MLE</tt> and custom distributions to fit a model to censored data, using the extreme value distribution.
      </p>
      <p>Because the values for the censored data are not known exactly, maximum likelihood estimation becomes more difficult.  In
         particular, both the PDF and the CDF are needed to compute the log-likelihood.  Therefore, you must provide <tt>MLE</tt> with functions for both of those in order to fit censored data.  The Statistics Toolbox includes the functions <tt>EVPDF</tt> and <tt>EVCDF</tt>, so for this example, the work of writing the code has already been done.
      </p>
      <p>We'll fit the model to simulated data.  The first step is to generate some uncensored extreme value data.</p><pre class="codeinput">rand(<span class="string">'state'</span>,0); randn(<span class="string">'state'</span>,0);

</pre><p>Next, we censor any values that are larger than a predetermined cutoff, by replacing those values with the cutoff value. 
         This is known as Type II censoring, and with the cutoff at 7, about 10% of the original data end up being censored.

</pre><h2>Some numerical issues in fitting custom distributions<a name="9"></a></h2>
      <p>Fitting a custom distribution requires an initial guess for the parameters, and it's often difficult to know how good or bad
         a starting point is a priori.  In the previous example, if we had picked a starting point that was farther away from the maximum
         likelihood estimates, some of the observations could have been very far out in the tails of the extreme value distribution
         corresponding to the starting point.  One of two things might then have happened.
      </p>
      <p>First, one of the PDF values might have become so small that it underflowed to zero in double precision arithmetic.  Second,
         one of the CDF values might have become so close to 1 that it rounded up in double precision.  (It's also possible that a
         CDF value might have become so small as to underflow, but that turns out not to be a problem.)
      </p>
      <p>Either of these conditions causes problems when <tt>MLE</tt> computes the log-likelihood, because they lead to log-likelihood values of -Inf, and the optimization algorithm in <tt>MLE</tt> can not normally be expected to step out of such regions.
      </p>
      <p>Knowing what the maximum likelihood estimates are, let's see what happens with a different starting point.</p><pre class="codeinput">start = [1 1];

The CDF function returned values greater than or equal to 1.
</pre><p>In this case, the second problem has occurred:  Some of the CDF values at the initial parameter guess are computed as exactly
         1, and so the log-likelihood is infinite.  We could try setting <tt>MLE</tt>'s 'FunValCheck' control parameter to 'off', which would disable checking for non-finite likelihood values, and then hope
         for the best.  But the right way to solve this numerical problem is at its root, and in this case it's not hard to do.

         log(1-CDF).  For the extreme value distribution, the log of the SF is just -exp((x-mu)./sigma).  If we could compute the log-likelihood
         using the log SF directly, (instead of, in effect, computing log(1 - (1-exp(logSF)))) we would avoid the rounding issues with
         the CDF.  That's because observations whose CDF values are not distinguishable from 1 in double precision have log SF values
         that are still easily representable as non-zero values.  For example, a CDF value of (1 - 1e-20) rounds to 1 in double precision,
         because double precision <tt>eps</tt> is about 2e-16.

</pre><p>A similar observation can be made about using the log PDF rather than the PDF itself -- the contribution of uncensored observations

         avoids underflow problems where the PDF is not distinguishable from zero in double precision, but the log PDF is still easily
         representable as a finite negative number.  For example, a PDF value of 1e-400 underflows in double precision, because double

      </p>
      <p>However, for some problems, choosing an optimization algorithm that uses the derivatives of the log-likelihood function can

%% Fitting custom distributions with censored data
% The extreme value distribution is often used to model failure times of
% mechanical parts, and experiments in such cases are sometimes only run
% for a fixed length of time.  If not all of the experimental units have
% failed within that time, then the data are right-censored, that is, the
% value of some failure times are not known exactly, but only known to be
% larger than a certain value.

%%
% The Statistics Toolbox includes the function |EVFIT|, which fits an extreme
% value distribution to data, including data with censoring.  However, for
% the purposes of this example, we will ignore |EVFIT|, and demonstrate how
% to use |MLE| and custom distributions to fit a model to censored data,
% using the extreme value distribution.

%%
% Because the values for the censored data are not known exactly, maximum
% likelihood estimation becomes more difficult.  In particular, both the
% PDF and the CDF are needed to compute the log-likelihood.  Therefore, you
% must provide |MLE| with functions for both of those in order to fit
% censored data.  The Statistics Toolbox includes the functions |EVPDF| and
% |EVCDF|, so for this example, the work of writing the code has already been
% done.

% We'll fit the model to simulated data.  The first step is to generate some
% uncensored extreme value data.
rand('state',0); randn('state',0);
n = 50;
mu = 5;
sigma = 2.5;
x = evrnd(mu,sigma,n,1);

%%
% Next, we censor any values that are larger than a predetermined cutoff,
% by replacing those values with the cutoff value.  This is known as Type
% II censoring, and with the cutoff at 7, about 10% of the original data
% end up being censored.
c = (x > 7);
x(c) = 7;
sum(c)/length(c)

%%
% We can plot a histogram of these data, including a stacked bar to
% represent the censored observations.
[uncensCnts,binCtrs] = hist(x(~c));
censCnts = hist(x(c),binCtrs);
bar(binCtrs,[uncensCnts' censCnts'],'stacked');

%%
% Although there is censoring, the fraction of censored observations is
% relatively small, and so the method of moments can provide a reasonable
% starting point for the parameter estimates.  We compute the values of mu
% and sigma that correspond to the observed mean and standard deviation of
% the uncensored data.
sigma0 = sqrt(6)*std(x(~c))./pi
mu0 = mean(x(~c))-psi(1).*sigma0

%%
% In addition to passing the data, x, and handles to the PDF and CDF
% functions into |MLE|, we also use the 'censoring' parameter to pass in the
% censoring vector, c.  Because the scale parameter, sigma, must be
% positive, we specify lower parameter bounds.  |MLE| returns the maximum

% created code to do that for the extreme value distribution as a separate
% M-file <matlab:edit('evnegloglike.m') |evnegloglike.m|>.
type evnegloglike.m

%%
% Notice that the function |EVNEGLOGLIKE| returns the _negative_ of both
% the log-likehood values and of the gradient values, because MLE
% _minimizes_ that negative log-likelihood.

%%
% To compute the maximum likelihood estimates using a gradient-based
% optimization algorithm, we use the 'nloglf' parameter, specifying that we
% are providing a handle to a function that computes the negative
% log-likelihood, and the 'optimfun' parameter, specifying |FMINCON| as the
% optimization function.  |MLE| will automatically detect that
% |EVNEGLOGLIKE| can return both the negative log-likelihood and its
% gradient.
