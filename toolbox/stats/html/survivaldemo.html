      <h1>Analyzing survival or reliability data</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>In this demo we consider the analysis of lifetime data.  In biological or medical applications, this is known as survival
            analysis, and the times may represent the survival time of an organism or the time until a disease is cured.  In engineering
            applications, this is known as reliability analysis, and the times may represent the time to failure of a piece of equipment.
         </p>
         <p>To demonstrate how to use MATLAB and the Statistics Toolbox to analyze lifetime data, we'll look at an application in modeling
            the time to failure of a throttle from an automobile fuel injection system.

      <h2>Special properties of lifetime data<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>Some features of lifetime data distinguish them other types of data. First, the lifetimes are always positive values, usually
         representing time.  Second, some lifetimes may not be observed exactly, so that they are known only to be larger than some
         value.  Third, the distributions and analysis techniques that are commonly used are fairly specific to lifetime data
      </p>
      <p>Let's simulate the results of testing 100 throttles until failure.  We'll generate data that might be observed if most throttles
         had a fairly long lifetime, but a small percentage tended to fail very early.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">rand(<span class="string">'state'</span>,1);
lifetime = [wblrnd(15000,3,90,1); wblrnd(1500,3,10,1)];
</pre><p>In this example, assume that we are testing the throttles under stressful conditions, so that each hour of testing is equivalent
         to 100 hours of actual use in the field.  For pragmatic reasons, it's often the case that reliability tests are stopped after
         a fixed amount of time.  For this example, we will use 140 hours, equivalent to a total of 14,000 hours of real service. 
         Some items fail during the test, while others survive the entire 140 hours.  In a real test, the times for the latter would
         be recorded as 14,000, and we mimic this in the simulated data.  It is also common practice to sort the failure times.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">T = 14000;

      <p>Before we examine the distribution of the data, let's consider different ways of looking at a probability distribution.</p>
      <div>
         <ul>
            <li>A probability density function (PDF) indicates the relative probability   of failure at different times.</li>
            <li>A survivor function gives the probability of survival as a   function of time, and is simply one minus the cumulative distribution
                 function (1-CDF).
            </li>
            <li>The hazard rate gives the instantaneous probability of failure   given survival to a given time.  It is the PDF divided by
               the survivor   function.  In this example the hazard rates turn out to be increasing,   meaning the items are more susceptible
               to failure as time passes   (aging).
            </li>
            <li>A probability plot is a re-scaled CDF, and is used to compare data   to a fitted distribution.</li>

      <p>The Weibull distribution is a generalization of the exponential distribution.  If lifetimes follow an exponential distribution,
         then they have a constand hazard rate.  This means that they do not age, in the sense that the probability of observing a
         failure in an interval, given survival to the start of that interval, doesn't depend on where the interval starts.  A Weibull
         distribution has a hazard rate that may increase or decrease.
      </p>
      <p>Other distributions used for modeling lifetime data include the lognormal, gamma, and Burnbaum-Saunders distributions.</p>
      <p>We will plot the empirical cumulative distribution function of our data, showing the proportion failing up to each possible
         survival time.  The dotted curves give 95% confidence intervals for these probabilities.

          However, it appears the fitted curve does not match our data well.  We have too many early failures before time 2,000 compared
         with what the Weibull model would predict, and as a result, too few for times between about 7,000 and about 13,000.  This
         is not surprising -- recall that we generated data with just this sort of behavior.

         and again later in its life (aging).
      </p>
      <p>Also notice that the hazard rate cannot be estimated above the largest uncensored observation for the nonparametric model,

      <h2>Alternative models<a name="12"></a></h2>
      <p>For the simulated data we've used for this example, we found that a Weibull distribution was not a suitable fit.  We were
         able to fit the data well with a nonparametric fit, but that model was only useful within the range of the data.
      </p>
      <p>One alternative would be to use a different parametric distribution.  The Statistics Toolbox has includes functions for other
         common lifetime distributions such as the lognormal, gamma, and Burbaum-Saunders, as well as many other distributions that
         are not commonly used in lifetime models.  You can also define and fit custom parametric models to lifetime data, as described
         in the <a href="customdist2demo.html">Fitting Custom Univariate Distributions, Part 2</a> demo.
      </p>
      <p>Another alternative would be to use a mixture of two parametric distributions -- one representing early failure and the other
         representing the rest of the distribution.  Fitting mixtures of distributions is described in the <a href="customdist1demo.html">Fitting Custom Univariate Distributions</a> demo.

% The nonparametric estimate with the smaller smoothing parameter matches the
% data well.  However, just as for the empirical CDF, it is not possible
% to extrapolate the nonparametric model beyond the end of the test REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH the
% estimated CDF levels off above the last observation.
%
% Let's compute the hazard rate for this nonparametric fit and plot it over
% the range of the data.
hazrate = ksdensity(obstime,xx,'cens',censored,'width',u/3) ./ (1-npF3);
plot(xx,hazrate)
title('Hazard Rate for Nonparametric Model')
xlim([0 T])

%%
% This curve has a bit of a "bathtub" shape, with a hazard rate that is
% high near 2,000, drops to lower values, then rises again.  This is typical
% of the hazard rate for a component that is more susceptible to failure
% early in its life (infant mortality), and again later in its life
% (aging).
%
% Also notice that the hazard rate cannot be estimated above the largest
% uncensored observation for the nonparametric model, and the graph drops
% to zero.

%% Alternative models
% For the simulated data we've used for this example, we found that a
% Weibull distribution was not a suitable fit.  We were able to fit the
% data well with a nonparametric fit, but that model was only useful within
% the range of the data.
%
% One alternative would be to use a different parametric distribution.  The
% Statistics Toolbox has includes functions for other common lifetime
% distributions such as the lognormal, gamma, and Burbaum-Saunders, as well
% as many other distributions that are not commonly used in lifetime
% models.  You can also define and fit custom parametric models to lifetime
% data, as described in the <customdist2demo.html Fitting Custom Univariate
% Distributions, Part 2> demo.
%
% Another alternative would be to use a mixture of two parametric
% distributions REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH one representing early failure and the other
% representing the rest of the distribution.  Fitting mixtures of
% distributions is described in the <customdist1demo.html Fitting Custom
% Univariate Distributions> demo.
