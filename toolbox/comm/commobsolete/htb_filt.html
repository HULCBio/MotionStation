<dl><dd><b>
Raised Cosine Filter
</b>
Filter the input signal using a raised cosine filter to 
narrow the bandwidth of a digital signal transmission

<dd><b>
Sinc Filter
</b>
Output the zero-crossing value in one sample time 
interval. The zero-crossing timing is provided by the 
rising edge of the trigger signal

<dd><b>
Hilbert Filter
</b>
Design a Hilbert filter and filter the input signal using the
designed Hilbert filter.
