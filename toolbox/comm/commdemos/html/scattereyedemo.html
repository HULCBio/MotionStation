      <p>Plotting a modulated, filtered signal using PLOT does not display the characteristics of the modulation as clearly as the
         eye diagram and scatter plot.  The eye diagram overlays many short segments, called traces, to reveal the signal characteristics.
          The scatter plot samples the signal at the symbol time and displays it in signal space.  The sampling rate of 16 highlights
         the plotting functions' capability.
