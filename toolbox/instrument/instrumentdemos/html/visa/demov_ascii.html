      <h2>Introduction<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>This tutorial explores ASCII read and write operations with a VISA object.</p>
      <p>The information obtained for this tutorial was prerecorded. Therefore, you do not need an actual instrument to learn about
         VISA ASCII read and write operations.
      </p>
      <p>The instruments used include an Agilent E1406A command module in VXI slot 0 and an Agilent E1441A instrument in VXI slot 1.</p>
      <p>The HP E1406A is a GPIB controller and it is connected to a GPIB board. The HP E1441A is a function/arbitrary waveform generator.
         The GPIB controller will communicate with the HP E1441A function generator over the VXI backplane.
      </p>
      <h2>The Supported VISA Interfaces<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>The VISA object supports seven interfaces:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>serial</li>
         <li>GPIB</li>
         <li>VXI</li>
         <li>GPIB-VXI</li>
         <li>TCPIP</li>
         <li>USB</li>
         <li>RSIB</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This tutorial explores ASCII read and write operations using a VISA-GPIB-VXI object. However, ASCII read and write operations
         for VISA-GPIB, VISA-VXI, VISA-GPIB-VXI, VISA-TCPIP, and VISA-USB objects are identical to each other. Therefore, you can use
         the same commands. The only difference is the resource name specified in the VISA constructor.
      </p>
      <p>ASCII read and write operations for the VISA-serial object are identical to ASCII read and write operations for the serial
         port object. Therefore, to learn how to perform ASCII read and write operations for the VISA-serial object, you should refer
         to the Serial Port ASCII Read/Write tutorial.
      </p>
      <p>ASCII read and write operations for the VISA-RSIB object are identical to the ASCII read and write operations for the VISA-GPIB,
         VISA-VXI, VISA-GPIB-VXI, VISA-TCPIP, and VISA-USB objects, except the VISA-RSIB object does not support the EOSCharCode and
         EOSMode properties.
      </p>
      <h2>Functions and Properties<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>These functions are used when reading and writing text:</p><pre>FPRINTF          - Write text to instrument.
FSCANF           - Read data from instrument and format as
                   text.</pre><p>These properties are associated with reading and writing text:</p><pre>ValuesReceived   - Specifies the total number of values
                   read from the instrument.
ValuesSent       - Specifies the total number of values
                   sent to the instrument.
InputBufferSize  - Specifies the total number of bytes
                   that can be queued in the input buffer
                   at one time.
OutputBufferSize - Specifies the total number of bytes
                   that can be queued in the output buffer
                   at one time.
EOSMode          - Configures the End-Of-String termination
                   mode.
EOSCharCode      - Specifies the End-Of-String terminator.
EOIMode          - Enables or disables the assertion of
                   the EOI line at the end of a write
                   operation.</pre><h2>Creating a VISA Object<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>To begin, create a VISA-GPIB-VXI object. The HP E1441A instrument is configured with a logical address of 80 and is in the
         first chassis.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; v = visa('agilent', 'GPIB-VXI0::80::INSTR')</pre><pre>  VISA-GPIB-VXI Object Using AGILENT Adaptor: VISA-GPIB-VXI0-80</pre><pre>  Communication Address

     BytesAvailable:     0
     ValuesReceived:     0
     ValuesSent:         0</pre><h2>Connecting the VISA Object to Your Instrument<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <p>Before you can perform a read or write operation, you must connect the VISA-GPIB-VXI object to the instrument with the FOPEN
         function. If the object was successfully connected, its Status property is automatically configured to open.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fopen(v)
&gt;&gt; v</pre><pre>  VISA-GPIB-VXI Object Using AGILENT Adaptor: VISA-GPIB-VXI0-80</pre><pre>  Communication Address

     TransferStatus:     idle
     BytesAvailable:     0
     ValuesReceived:     0
     ValuesSent:         0</pre><h2>Writing ASCII Data<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>You use the FPRINTF function to write ASCII data to the instrument. For example, the 'Volt 2' command changes the signal's
         peak-to-peak voltage to 4 volts.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(v, 'Volt 2')</pre><p>By default, FPRINTF operates in synchronous mode. This means that the function blocks until one of the following occurs:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>All the data is written</li>
         <li>A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By default, FPRINTF writes ASCII data using the %s\n format. You can also specify the format of the command written by providing
         a third input argument to FPRINTF. The accepted format conversion characters include: d, i, o, u, x, X, f, e, E, g, G, c,
         and s.
      </p>
      <p>For example,</p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(v, '%s', 'Volt 3')</pre><h2>ASCII Write Properties -- OutputBufferSize<a name="7"></a></h2>
      <p>The OutputBufferSize property specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be written to the instrument at once. By default,
         OutputBufferSize is 512.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(v, 'OutputBufferSize')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>512</pre><p>If the command specified in FPRINTF contains more than 512 bytes, an error is returned and no data is written to the instrument.</p>
      <h2>ASCII Write Properties -- EOIMode, EOSMode, and EOSCharCode<a name="8"></a></h2>
      <p>By default, the End or Identify (EOI) line is asserted when the last byte is written to the instrument. This behavior is controlled
         by the EOIMode property. When EOIMode is set to on, the EOI line is asserted when the last byte is written to the instrument.
         When EOIMode is set to off, the EOI line is not asserted when the last byte is written to the instrument.
      </p>
      <p>All occurrences of \n in the command written to the instrument are replaced with the EOSCharCode property value if EOSMode
         is set to write or read&amp;write.
      </p>
      <h2>ASCII Write Properties -- ValuesSent<a name="9"></a></h2>
      <p>The ValuesSent property is updated by the number of values written to the instrument. Note that by default EOSMode is set
         to none. Therefore, EOSCharCode is not sent as the last byte of the write.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(v, 'Volt 2')
&gt;&gt; get(v, 'ValuesSent')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>    18</pre><h2>Reading ASCII Data<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>The FSCANF function reads ASCII data from the instrument. For example, the 'Volt?' command returns the signal's peak-to-peak
         voltage.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(v, 'Volt?')
&gt;&gt; data = fscanf(v)</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>+2.00000E+00</pre><p>FSCANF blocks until one of the following occurs:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>The EOI line is asserted</li>
         <li>The terminator is received as defined by the EOSCharCode property</li>
         <li>A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property</li>
         <li>The input buffer is filled</li>
         <li>The specified number of values is received</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By default, FSCANF reads ASCII data using the %c format. You can also specify the format of the data read by providing a second
         input argument to FSCANF. The accepted format conversion characters include: d, i, o, u, x, X, f, e, E, g, G, c, and s.
      </p>
      <p>For example, the following command will return the voltage as a double:</p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(v, 'Volt?')
&gt;&gt; data = fscanf(v, '%g')</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>    2</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; isnumeric(data)</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>    1</pre><h2>ASCII Read Properties -- InputBufferSize<a name="11"></a></h2>
      <p>The InputBufferSize property specifies the maximum number of bytes that you can read from the instrument. By default, InputBufferSize
         is 512.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(v, 'InputBufferSize')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>   512</pre><h2>ASCII Read Properties -- ValuesReceived<a name="12"></a></h2>
      <p>The ValuesReceived property is updated by the number of values read from the instrument. Note the last value received is a
         linefeed.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(v, 'Volt?')
&gt;&gt; data = fscanf(v)</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>+2.00000E+00</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; get(v, 'ValuesReceived')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>   39</pre><h2>ASCII Read Properties -- EOSMode and EOSCharCode<a name="13"></a></h2>
      <p>To terminate the data transfer based on receiving EOSCharCode, you should set the EOSMode property to read or read&amp;write and
         the EOSCharCode property to the ASCII code for which the read operation should terminate. For example, if you set EOSMode
         to read and EOSCharCode to 10, then one of the ways that the read terminates is when the linefeed character is received.
      </p>
      <p>Configure the VISA-GPIB-VXI object to terminate the read operation when the 'E' character is received.</p>
      <p>The first read terminates when the 'E' character is received.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; set(v, 'EOSMode', 'read')
&gt;&gt; set(v, 'EOSCharCode', double('E'))
&gt;&gt; fprintf(v, 'Volt?')
&gt;&gt; data = fscanf(v)</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>+2.00000E</pre><p>If you perform a second read operation, it terminates when the EOI line is asserted.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; data = fscanf(v)</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>+00</pre><h2>Cleanup<a name="14"></a></h2>
      <p>If you are finished with the VISA-GPIB-VXI object, disconnect it from the instrument, remove it from memory, and remove it

%% Introduction
% This tutorial explores ASCII read and write operations 
% with a VISA object.
% 
% The information obtained for this tutorial was prerecorded. Therefore,
% you do not need an actual instrument to learn about VISA ASCII read and
% write operations. 
% 
% The instruments used include an Agilent E1406A command module in VXI slot
% 0 and an Agilent E1441A instrument in VXI slot 1.  
% 
% The HP E1406A is a GPIB controller and it is connected 
% to a GPIB board. The HP E1441A is a function/arbitrary

% backplane.

%% The Supported VISA Interfaces
% The VISA object supports seven interfaces:
%
% * serial
% * GPIB
% * VXI
% * GPIB-VXI
% * TCPIP
% * USB
% * RSIB
% 
% This tutorial explores ASCII read and write operations
% using a VISA-GPIB-VXI object. However, ASCII read and

% VISA-TCPIP, and VISA-USB objects are identical to each other. 
% Therefore, you can use the same commands. The only difference
% is the resource name specified in the VISA constructor. 
% 
% ASCII read and write operations for the VISA-serial object
% are identical to ASCII read and write operations for the
% serial port object. Therefore, to learn how to perform ASCII
% read and write operations for the VISA-serial object,
% you should refer to the Serial Port ASCII Read/Write tutorial.
% 
% ASCII read and write operations for the VISA-RSIB object are
% identical to the ASCII read and write operations for the 
% VISA-GPIB, VISA-VXI, VISA-GPIB-VXI, VISA-TCPIP, and VISA-USB
% objects, except the VISA-RSIB object does not support the
% EOSCharCode and EOSMode properties.

%                     operation.

%% Creating a VISA Object
% To begin, create a VISA-GPIB-VXI object. The HP
% E1441A instrument is configured with a logical address
% of 80 and is in the first chassis.
%

%       ValuesSent:         0

%% Writing ASCII Data
% You use the FPRINTF function to write ASCII data to 
% the instrument. For example, the 'Volt 2' command
% changes the signal's peak-to-peak voltage to 4 volts. 
% 
%  >> fprintf(v, 'Volt 2')
% 
% By default, FPRINTF operates in synchronous mode. This
% means that the function blocks until one of the following 
% occurs:
%
% * All the data is written
% * A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property
% 
% By default, FPRINTF writes ASCII data using the %s\n 
% format. You can also specify the format of the command 
% written by providing a third input argument to FPRINTF.  
% The accepted format conversion characters include: d, i,
% o, u, x, X, f, e, E, g, G, c, and s.
% 
% For example,
% 
%  >> fprintf(v, '%s', 'Volt 3')


%% ASCII Write Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH OutputBufferSize
% The OutputBufferSize property specifies the maximum
% number of bytes that can be written to the instrument 
% at once. By default, OutputBufferSize is 512.  
%
%  >> get(v, 'OutputBufferSize')
%
%  ans =
%
%  512
%
% If the command specified in FPRINTF contains more than
% 512 bytes, an error is returned and no data is written
% to the instrument.
%

%% ASCII Write Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH EOIMode, EOSMode, and EOSCharCode 
% By default, the End or Identify (EOI) line is asserted 
% when the last byte is written to the instrument. This 
% behavior is controlled by the EOIMode property. When 
% EOIMode is set to on, the EOI line is asserted when 
% the last byte is written to the instrument. When EOIMode
% is set to off, the EOI line is not asserted when the
% last byte is written to the instrument.
%
% All occurrences of \n in the command written to the 
% instrument are replaced with the EOSCharCode property  
% value if EOSMode is set to write or read&write.

%% ASCII Write Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH ValuesSent
% The ValuesSent property is updated by the number of 
% values written to the instrument. Note that by default
% EOSMode is set to none. Therefore, EOSCharCode is not
% sent as the last byte of the write.
% 
%  >> fprintf(v, 'Volt 2')
%  >> get(v, 'ValuesSent')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%      18

%% Reading ASCII Data
% The FSCANF function reads ASCII data from the instrument.
% For example, the 'Volt?' command returns the signal's 
% peak-to-peak voltage. 
% 
%  >> fprintf(v, 'Volt?')
%  >> data = fscanf(v)
% 
%  data =
% 
%  +2.00000E+00
%
% FSCANF blocks until one of the following occurs:  
%
% * The EOI line is asserted
% * The terminator is received as defined by the EOSCharCode property
% * A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property
% * The input buffer is filled
% * The specified number of values is received
%
% By default, FSCANF reads ASCII data using the %c format.
% You can also specify the format of the data read by 
% providing a second input argument to FSCANF. The 
% accepted format conversion characters include: 
% d, i, o, u, x, X, f, e, E, g, G, c, and s. 
%
% For example, the following command will return the 
% voltage as a double:
%
%  >> fprintf(v, 'Volt?')
%  >> data = fscanf(v, '%g')
%
%  data =
%
%      2
%
%  >> isnumeric(data)
%
%  ans =
%
%      1

%% ASCII Read Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH InputBufferSize
% The InputBufferSize property specifies the maximum 
% number of bytes that you can read from the instrument.
% By default, InputBufferSize is 512.  
%
%  >> get(v, 'InputBufferSize')
%
%  ans =
%
%     512
%

%% ASCII Read Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH ValuesReceived
% The ValuesReceived property is updated by the number of
% values read from the instrument. Note the last value 
% received is a linefeed.
%
%  >> fprintf(v, 'Volt?')
%  >> data = fscanf(v)

%
%  +2.00000E+00
%
%  >> get(v, 'ValuesReceived')
%
%  ans =
% 
%     39
%

%% ASCII Read Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH EOSMode and EOSCharCode
% To terminate the data transfer based on receiving 
% EOSCharCode, you should set the EOSMode property to 
% read or read&write and the EOSCharCode property 
% to the ASCII code for which the read operation should 
% terminate. For example, if you set EOSMode to read 
% and EOSCharCode to 10, then one of the ways that the read 
% terminates is when the linefeed character is received. 
%
% Configure the VISA-GPIB-VXI object to terminate the read 
% operation when the 'E' character is received. 
%
% The first read terminates when the 'E' character is received. 
%
%  >> set(v, 'EOSMode', 'read')
%  >> set(v, 'EOSCharCode', double('E'))
%  >> fprintf(v, 'Volt?')
%  >> data = fscanf(v)
%
%  data =
%
%  +2.00000E
%
% If you perform a second read operation, it terminates when 
% the EOI line is asserted. 
%
%  >> data = fscanf(v)
%
%  data =
%
%  +00

%% Cleanup
% If you are finished with the VISA-GPIB-VXI object, disconnect 
% it from the instrument, remove it from memory, and remove it
% from the workspace.
% 
%  >> fclose(v)
%  >> delete(v)
%  >> clear v
