      <h2>Introduction<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>This demo explores asynchronous read and write operations using a VISA-GPIB-VXI object.</p>
      <p>The information obtained for this tutorial was prerecorded. Therefore, you do not need an actual instrument to learn about
         asynchronous read and write operations for VISA objects.
      </p>
      <p>The instruments used included an Agilent E1406A command module in VXI slot 0 and an Agilent E1441A instrument in VXI slot
         1.
      </p>
      <p>The HP E1406A is a GPIB controller and it is connected to a GPIB board. The HP E1441A is a function/arbitrary waveform generator.
         The GPIB controller will communicate with the HP E1441A function generator over the VXI backplane.
      </p>
      <h2>The Supported VISA Interfaces<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>The VISA object supports seven interfaces:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>serial</li>
         <li>GPIB</li>
         <li>VXI</li>
         <li>GPIB-VXI</li>
         <li>TCPIP</li>
         <li>USB</li>
         <li>RSIB</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This tutorial explores asynchronous read and write operations for a VISA-GPIB-VXI object. However, asynchronous read and write
         operations for VISA-GPIB, VISA-VXI, VISA-GPIB-VXI, VISA-TCPIP, and VISA-USB objects are identical to each other. Therefore,
         you can use the same commands. The only difference is the resource name specified in the VISA constructor.
      </p>
      <p>Asynchronous read and write operations for the VISA-serial object are identical to asynchronous read and write operations
         for the serial port object. Therefore, to learn how to perform asynchronous read and write operations for the VISA-serial
         object, you should refer to the Serial Port Asynchronous Read/Write tutorial.
      </p>
      <p>Asynchronous read and write operations are not supported for the VISA-RSIB object.</p>
      <h2>Functions and Properties<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>These functions are associated with reading and writing text asynchronously:</p><pre>FPRINTF        - Write text to instrument.
READASYNC      - Asynchronously read bytes from an instrument.
STOPASYNC      - Stop an asynchronous read and write operation.</pre><p>These properties are associated with ASCII read and write asynchronous operations:</p><pre>BytesAvailable - Indicate the number of bytes available in
                 the input buffer.
TransferStatus - Indicate what type of asynchronous operation
                 is in progress.</pre><p>Additionally, you can use all callback properties during asynchronous read and write operations.</p>
      <h2>Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Operations<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>The VISA object can operate in either synchronous or asynchronous mode.</p>
      <p>In synchronous mode, the MATLAB command line is blocked until</p>
      <ul>
         <li>The read or write operation completes</li>
         <li>A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In asynchronous mode, control is immediately returned to the MATLAB command line. Additionally, you can use callback properties
         and callback functions to perform tasks as data is being written or read. For example, you can create a callback function
         that notifies you when the read or write operation has finished.
      </p>
      <h2>Creating a VISA Object<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <p>To begin, create a VISA-GPIB-VXI object. The HP E1441A instrument is configured with a logical address of 80 and is in the
         first chassis.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; v = visa('agilent', 'GPIB-VXI0::80::INSTR')</pre><pre>  VISA-GPIB-VXI Object Using AGILENT Adaptor : VISA-GPIB-VXI0-80</pre><pre>  Communication Address
     ChassisIndex:       0
     LogicalAddress:     80</pre><pre>  Communication State
     Status:             closed
     RecordStatus:       off</pre><pre>  Read/Write State
     TransferStatus:     idle
     BytesAvailable:     0
     ValuesReceived:     0
     ValuesSent:         0</pre><h2>Connecting the VISA Object to Your Instrument<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>Before you can perform a read or write operation, you must connect the VISA-GPIB-VXI object to the instrument with the FOPEN
         function. If the object was successfully connected, its Status property is automatically configured to open, otherwise the
         Status property remains configured to closed.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fopen(v)
&gt;&gt; get(v, 'Status')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>open</pre><h2>Reading Data Asynchronously<a name="7"></a></h2>
      <p>The VISA-GPIB-VXI object's asynchronous read functionality is controlled with the READASYNC function.Query the instrument
         for the signal's voltage:
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(v, 'Volt?');</pre><p>The READASYNC function can asynchronously read the data from the instrument. The READASYNC function returns control to the
         MATLAB command prompt immediately.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; readasync(v, 20)</pre><p>The READASYNC function without a SIZE specified will assume SIZE is given by the difference between the InputBufferSize property
         value and the BytesAvailable property value. In the above example, SIZE is 20. The asynchronous read terminates when one of
         the following occurs:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>The specified number of bytes are stored in the input   buffer</li>
         <li>The terminator has been read as specified by the EOSCharCode   property</li>
         <li>The EOI line has been asserted</li>
         <li>A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An error event will be generated if READASYNC terminates due to a timeout.</p>
      <h2>Asynchronous Read Properties -- TransferStatus<a name="8"></a></h2>
      <p>The TransferStatus property indicates what type of asynchronous operation is in progress. For VISA-GPIB-VXI objects, TransferStatus
         can be configured as read, write, or idle.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(v, 'TransferStatus')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>read</pre><p>While an asynchronous read is in progress, an error occurs if you execute another write or asynchronous read operation. You
         can stop the asynchronous read operation with the STOPASYNC function. The data in the input buffer will remain after STOPASYNC
         is called. This allows you to bring the data that was read into the MATLAB workspace with one of the synchronous read routines
         (FSCANF, FGETL, FGETS, or FREAD).
      </p>
      <h2>Asynchronous Read Properties - BytesAvailable<a name="9"></a></h2>
      <p>If you look at the BytesAvailable property, you see that 13 bytes have been read. The data can be brought into the MATLAB
         workspace with the FSCANF function.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(v, 'BytesAvailable')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>   13</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; data = fscanf(v)</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>+2.00000E+00</pre><h2>Defining an Asynchronous Read Callback<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>Now, configure our VISA-GPIB-VXI object to notify you when a line feed has been read. The BytesAvailableFcnMode property controls
         when the BytesAvailable event is created. By default, the BytesAvailable event is created when the EOSCharCode character is
         received. The BytesAvailable event can also be created after a certain number of bytes have been read. Note: the BytesAvailableFcnMode
         property cannot be configured while the object is connected to the instrument.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; set(v, 'BytesAvailableFcn', {'dispcallback'})
&gt;&gt; set(v, 'EOSCharCode', 10);</pre><h2>The Callback Function<a name="11"></a></h2>
      <p>The DISPCALLBACK callback function is defined as follows.</p><pre>function dispcallback(obj, event)

%
%    DISPCALLBACK(OBJ, EVENT) a callback function that displays

      <p>Now, query the instrument for the frequency of the signal. Once the linefeed has been read from the instrument and placed
         in the input buffer, DISPCALLBACK will be executed and a message will be displayed to the MATLAB command window indicating
         that a BytesAvailable event occurred.

%% Introduction
% This demo explores asynchronous read and write operations
% using a VISA-GPIB-VXI object.
% 
% The information obtained for this tutorial was prerecorded. Therefore,
% you do not need an actual instrument to learn about asynchronous read and
% write operations for VISA objects. 
% 
% The instruments used included an Agilent E1406A command module in VXI
% slot 0 and an Agilent E1441A instrument in VXI slot 1.  
% 
% The HP E1406A is a GPIB controller and it is connected 
% to a GPIB board. The HP E1441A is a function/arbitrary
% waveform generator. The GPIB controller will communicate
% with the HP E1441A function generator over the VXI 
% backplane.

%% The Supported VISA Interfaces
% The VISA object supports seven interfaces:
%
% * serial
% * GPIB
% * VXI
% * GPIB-VXI
% * TCPIP
% * USB
% * RSIB
% 
% This tutorial explores asynchronous read and write operations
% for a VISA-GPIB-VXI object. However, asynchronous read and 
% write operations for VISA-GPIB, VISA-VXI, VISA-GPIB-VXI, 
% VISA-TCPIP, and VISA-USB objects are identical to each other. 
% Therefore, you can use the same commands. The only difference
% is the resource name specified in the VISA constructor.
% 
% Asynchronous read and write operations for the VISA-serial 
% object are identical to asynchronous read and write operations
% for the serial port object. Therefore, to learn how to perform
% asynchronous read and write operations for the VISA-serial
% object, you should refer to the Serial Port Asynchronous
% Read/Write tutorial.
% 
% Asynchronous read and write operations are not supported
% for the VISA-RSIB object.

%% Functions and Properties
% These functions are associated with reading and writing text 
% asynchronously:
% 
%  FPRINTF        - Write text to instrument.
%  READASYNC      - Asynchronously read bytes from an instrument.
%  STOPASYNC      - Stop an asynchronous read and write operation.
% 
% These properties are associated with ASCII read and write 
% asynchronous operations:
% 
%  BytesAvailable - Indicate the number of bytes available in
%                   the input buffer.
%  TransferStatus - Indicate what type of asynchronous operation
%                   is in progress.
% 
% Additionally, you can use all callback properties during
% asynchronous read and write operations.

%% Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Operations
% The VISA object can operate in either synchronous or 
% asynchronous mode. 
% 
% In synchronous mode, the MATLAB command line is blocked
% until
%
% * The read or write operation completes  
% * A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property
% 
% In asynchronous mode, control is immediately returned to the 
% MATLAB command line. Additionally, you can use callback 
% properties and callback functions to perform tasks as data
% is being written or read. For example, you can create a 
% callback function that notifies you when the read or write
% operation has finished.

%% Creating a VISA Object
% To begin, create a VISA-GPIB-VXI object. The HP
% E1441A instrument is configured with a logical address
% of 80 and is in the first chassis.
% 
%  >> v = visa('agilent', 'GPIB-VXI0::80::INSTR')
% 
%    VISA-GPIB-VXI Object Using AGILENT Adaptor : VISA-GPIB-VXI0-80
% 
%    Communication Address 
%       ChassisIndex:       0
%       LogicalAddress:     80
% 
%    Communication State 
%       Status:             closed
%       RecordStatus:       off
% 
%    Read/Write State  
%       TransferStatus:     idle
%       BytesAvailable:     0
%       ValuesReceived:     0
%       ValuesSent:         0

%% Connecting the VISA Object to Your Instrument
% Before you can perform a read or write operation, you
% must connect the VISA-GPIB-VXI object to the instrument 
% with the FOPEN function. If the object was successfully
% connected, its Status property is automatically configured
% to open, otherwise the Status property remains configured
% to closed.
% 
%  >> fopen(v)
%  >> get(v, 'Status')
%
%  ans =
%
%  open
%

%% Reading Data Asynchronously
% The VISA-GPIB-VXI object's asynchronous read functionality 
% is controlled with the READASYNC function.Query
% the instrument for the signal's voltage:
% 
%  >> fprintf(v, 'Volt?');
% 
% The READASYNC function can asynchronously read the data 
% from the instrument. The READASYNC function returns control
% to the MATLAB command prompt immediately.
% 
%  >> readasync(v, 20)
% 
% The READASYNC function without a SIZE specified will assume
% SIZE is given by the difference between the InputBufferSize
% property value and the BytesAvailable property value. In the 
% above example, SIZE is 20. The asynchronous read terminates
% when one of the following occurs: 
%
% * The specified number of bytes are stored in the input 
%   buffer
% * The terminator has been read as specified by the EOSCharCode
%   property
% * The EOI line has been asserted 
% * A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property
% 
% An error event will be generated if READASYNC terminates due 
% to a timeout.

%% Asynchronous Read Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH TransferStatus
% The TransferStatus property indicates what type of 
% asynchronous operation is in progress. For VISA-GPIB-VXI
% objects, TransferStatus can be configured as read, write,
% or idle.
% 
%  >> get(v, 'TransferStatus')
% 
%  ans = 
% 
%  read
% 
% While an asynchronous read is in progress, an error occurs
% if you execute another write or asynchronous read operation. 
% You can stop the asynchronous read operation with the 
% STOPASYNC function. The data in the input buffer will 
% remain after STOPASYNC is called. This allows you to
% bring the data that was read into the MATLAB workspace
% with one of the synchronous read routines (FSCANF, FGETL,
% FGETS, or FREAD).

%% Asynchronous Read Properties - BytesAvailable
% If you look at the BytesAvailable property, you see
% that 13 bytes have been read. The data can be brought
% into the MATLAB workspace with the FSCANF function. 
% 
%  >> get(v, 'BytesAvailable')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%     13
% 
%  >> data = fscanf(v)
% 
%  data =
% 
%  +2.00000E+00

%% Defining an Asynchronous Read Callback
% Now, configure our VISA-GPIB-VXI object to notify
% you when a line feed has been read. The BytesAvailableFcnMode
% property controls when the BytesAvailable event is created.
% By default, the BytesAvailable event is created when the 
% EOSCharCode character is received. The BytesAvailable event
% can also be created after a certain number of bytes have been 
% read. Note: the BytesAvailableFcnMode property cannot be 
% configured while the object is connected to the instrument.
% 
%  >> set(v, 'BytesAvailableFcn', {'dispcallback'})
%  >> set(v, 'EOSCharCode', 10);

%% The Callback Function
% The DISPCALLBACK callback function is defined as follows.
% 
%  function dispcallback(obj, event)
%  %DISPCALLBACK Display event information for the specified event.
%  % 
%  %    DISPCALLBACK(OBJ, EVENT) a callback function that displays  
%  %    a message which contains the type of the event, the name 
%  %    of the object which caused the event to occur and the 
%  %    time the event occurred.
%  %
%  %    See also INSTRCALLBACK.
% 
%  callbackTime = datestr(datenum(event.Data.AbsTime));
%  fprintf(['A ' event.Type ' event occurred for ' obj.Name ' at ' callbackTime '.\n']);

%% Using Callbacks During an Asynchronous Read
% Now, query the instrument for the frequency of the
% signal. Once the linefeed has been read from the instrument
% and placed in the input buffer, DISPCALLBACK will be executed 
% and a message will be displayed to the MATLAB command window
% indicating that a BytesAvailable event occurred.
% 
%  >> fprintf(v, 'Freq?')
%  >> readasync(v)
% 
%  A BytesAvailable event occurred for VISA-GPIB-VXI0-80 at 30-Dec-1999 03:48:18.
% 
%  >> get(v, 'BytesAvailable')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%     19
% 
%  >> data = fscanf(v, '%c', 19)
% 
%  data =
% 
%  +1.00000000000E+03
% 
% Note: the last value read is the line feed (10):
% 
%  >> real(data)
% 
%  ans =
% 
%   Columns 1 through 12 
% 
%     43    49    46    48    48    48    48    48    48    48    48    48
% 
%   Columns 13 through 19 
% 
%     48    48    69    43    48    51    10    

%% Writing Data Asynchronously
% You can perform an asynchronous write with the FPRINTF 
% or FWRITE functions by passing an 'async' flag as the
% last input argument. 
% 
% While an asynchronous write is in progress, an error occurs 
% if you execute a read or write operation. You can stop an 
% asynchronous write operation with the STOPASYNC function. 
% The data remaining in the output buffer will be flushed.
%

%% Defining an Asynchronous Write Callback
% Also configure the object to notify you when the
% write operation has completed.  
% 
%  >> set(v, 'OutputEmptyFcn', {'dispcallback'});
%  >> fprintf(v, 'Func:Shape?', 'async')
% 
%  A OutputEmpty event occurred for VISA-GPIB-VXI0-80 at 30-Dec-1999 3:52:33.
% 

%% Cleanup
% If you are finished with the VISA-GPIB-VXI object, disconnect 
% it from the instrument, remove it from memory, and remove it
% from the workspace.
% 
%  >> fclose(v)
%  >> delete(v)
%  >> clear v
