      <h2>Introduction<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>Virtual Instrument Standard Architecture (VISA) is a standard defined for communicating with instruments. The standard provides
         a common language for communicating with instruments, regardless of the interface.
      </p>
      <p>The Instrument Control Toolbox's VISA object supports seven communication interface types: serial, GPIB, GPIB-VXI, VXI, TCPIP,
         USB, and RSIB. Note, only National Instrument's VISA with the Rohde &amp; Schwarz VISA passport supports the RSIB interface type.
      </p>
      <h2>Supported Vendors<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>You create a VISA object using the VISA function.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; v = visa('Vendor', 'ResourceName');</pre><p>The following list defines the supported vendors:</p><pre>  Vendor                 Description

         1, and lan_device_name, which defaults to inst0.
      </p>
      <h2>The Serial Interface<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>Serial communication is the simplest and most common low-level protocol for communicating between two or more devices. Normally,
         one device is a computer, while the other device can be a modem, a printer, a data acquisition device, or another computer.
      </p>
      <p>As the name suggests, the serial port sends and receives bytes of information in a serial fashion, one bit at a time. These
         bytes can be transmitted using either a binary format or an ASCII format.
      </p>
      <p>Communication is accomplished using three transmission lines: the Transmit Data line, the Receive Data line, and the Ground.
         Other lines are available for handshaking, but are not required.
      </p>
      <h2>Creating a VISA-Serial Object<a name="5"></a></h2>

      </p>
      <h2>The GPIB Interface<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB), also known as the IEEE 488 interface, is a standard interface for communicating between
         two or more devices. The bus supports one controller (usually a computer) and up to fourteen additional instruments.
      </p>
      <p>Eight bits of data are transferred in parallel along the bus using a three wire handshake: the Data Valid line, the Not Data
         Accepted line, and the Not Ready for Data line. The three wire handshake assures reliable data transfer at the rate determined
         by the slowest device. Data transfer rates can exceed 1 Mbyte/second.
      </p>
      <h2>Creating a VISA-GPIB Object<a name="7"></a></h2>

     ValuesSent:         0</pre><p>The VISA-GPIB object, vgpib, communicates with an instrument through a GPIB board with board index 2. The instrument has a
         primary address of 4 and no secondary address. The National Instruments VISA DLL is installed on the computer and is used
         to communicate with the instrument.
      </p>
      <h2>The VXI Interface<a name="8"></a></h2>
      <p>A VXI system consists of a chassis, VXI instruments, a slot 0 card, and a resource manager. The slot 0 card controls the VXI
         backplane. The resource manager configures the modules for proper operation whenever the system is powered on or reset (the
         slot 0 card can also be the resource manager). The chassis holds the VXI instruments, the slot 0 card, and the resource manager,
         and contains the VXI backplane.
      </p>
      <p>VXI instruments can be either message-based or register- based. A message-based instrument is generally easier to use than
         a register-based instrument. While a register- based instrument is generally faster than a message-based instrument.
      </p>
      <p>The VXI interface uses an embedded VXI controller (in slot 0) to access the VXI instruments over the VXI backplane.</p>
      <h2>Creating a VISA-VXI Object<a name="9"></a></h2>

      </p>
      <h2>The GPIB-VXI Interface<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>The GPIB-VXI interface is similar to the VXI interface, however, there is a GPIB controller in slot 0. The GPIB controller
         contains a GPIB connector that is connected to a GPIB board in your computer. The GPIB controller can communicate to instruments
         in the chassis over the VXI backplane.

      <h2>The TCPIP Interface<a name="12"></a></h2>

%% The Serial Interface
% Serial communication is the simplest and most common low-level

% The following command creates a VISA-serial object.

%
% The VISA-serial object, vserial, communicates with an  
% instrument connected to the ASRL2 (which is 
% defined as the COM2) port. The Agilent Technologies VISA
% DLL is installed on the computer and used to communicate
% with the instrument.

% The VISA-GPIB object, vgpib, communicates with an 
% instrument through a GPIB board with board index 2. 
% The instrument has a primary address of 4 and no 
% secondary address. The National Instruments VISA DLL 
% is installed on the computer and is used to communicate 
% with the instrument.

%% The VXI Interface
% A VXI system consists of a chassis, VXI instruments,
% a slot 0 card, and a resource manager. The slot 0 card 
% controls the VXI backplane. The resource manager configures 
% the modules for proper operation whenever the system is 
% powered on or reset (the slot 0 card can also be the 
% resource manager). The chassis holds the VXI instruments, 
% the slot 0 card, and the resource manager, and contains the 
% VXI backplane. 
%
% VXI instruments can be either message-based or register-
% based. A message-based instrument is generally easier to 
% use than a register-based instrument. While a register- 
% based instrument is generally faster than a message-based 
% instrument.  
%
% The VXI interface uses an embedded VXI controller (in slot 0) 
% to access the VXI instruments over the VXI backplane.

%% Creating a VISA-VXI Object
% The following command creates a VISA-VXI object.
%
%  >> vvxi = visa('agilent', 'VXI0::8::INSTR')

%
% The VISA object, vvxi, communicates with a VXI instrument 
% located at logical address 8 in the first VXI chassis. The
% Agilent Technologies VISA DLL is installed on the computer
% and is used to communicate with the instrument.

%% The GPIB-VXI Interface
% The GPIB-VXI interface is similar to the VXI interface, 
% however, there is a GPIB controller in slot 0. The GPIB 
% controller contains a GPIB connector that is connected 
% to a GPIB board in your computer. The GPIB controller can
% communicate to instruments in the chassis over the VXI 
% backplane.

%% Creating a VISA-GPIB-VXI Object
% The following command creates a VISA-GPIB-VXI object.
%
%  >> vgpibvxi = visa('agilent', 'GPIB-VXI0::16::INSTR')

%
% The VISA object, vgpibvxi, communicates with a VXI instrument 
% located at logical address 16 in the first VXI system. The 
% Agilent Technologies VISA DLL is installed on the computer
% and is used to communicate with the instrument.

%% The TCPIP Interface
% The TCPIP interface allows you to communicate with an 
% instrument using the VXI-11 interface. It allows you
% to communicate with a networked instrument.

%% Creating a VISA-TCPIP Object
% The following command creates a VISA-TCPIP object.
%
%  >> vtcpip = visa('tek', 'TCPIP::216.148.60.170::INSTR')

%
% The VISA object, vtcpip, communicates with an instrument
% configured with IP address 216.148.60.170. The Tektronix
% VISA DLL is installed on the computer and is used to
% communicate with the instrument.

%% The USB Interface
% The USB interface allows you to communicate with an 
% instrument that has a USB interface. 

%% Creating a VISA-USB Object
% The following command creates a VISA-USB object.
%
%  >> vusb = visa('agilent', 'USB::0x1234::125::A22-5::INSTR')
