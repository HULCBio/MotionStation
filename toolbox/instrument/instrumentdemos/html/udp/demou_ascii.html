      <h2>Introduction<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>This demo explores ASCII read and write operations with a UDP object.</p>
      <p>The information obtained for this demonstration was prerecorded. Therefore, you do not need an actual instrument to learn
         about ASCII read and write operations using a UDP object. The instrument used was an echoserver on a Linux O/S PC. An echoserver
         is a service available from the O/S that returns to the sender's address and port, the same bytes it receives from the sender.
      </p>
      <h2>Functions and Properties<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>These functions are used when reading and writing text:</p><pre>FPRINTF          - Write text to instrument.
FSCANF           - Read data from instrument and format as
                   text.</pre><p>These properties are associated with reading and writing text:</p><pre>ValuesReceived   - Specifies the total number of values
                   read from the instrument.
ValuesSent       - Specifies the total number of values
                   sent to the instrument.
InputBufferSize  - Specifies the total number of bytes
                   that can be queued in the input buffer
                   at one time.
OutputBufferSize - Specifies the total number of bytes
                   that can be queued in the output buffer
                   at one time.
Terminator       - Character used to terminate commands
                   sent to the instrument.</pre><h2>Creating a UDP Object<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>To begin, create a UDP object associated with the host name daqlab11, port 7. The host name is assigned by your network administrator.
         Port 7 is the port number for the echoserver.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; u = udp('daqlab11', 7);
&gt;&gt; u</pre><pre>  UDP Object : UDP-daqlab11</pre><pre>  Communication Settings
     RemotePort:           7
     RemoteHost:           daqlab11
     Terminator:           'LF'%</pre><pre>  Communication State
     Status:               closed
     RecordStatus:         off</pre><pre>  Read/Write State
     TransferStatus:       idle
     BytesAvailable:       0
     ValuesReceived:       0
     ValuesSent:           0</pre><h2>Connecting the UDP Object to the Instrument<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>Before you can perform a read or write operation, you must connect the UDP object to the instrument with the FOPEN function.
         If the object was successfully connected, its Status property is automatically configured to open.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fopen(u)
&gt;&gt; get(u, 'Status')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>open</pre><h2>Writing ASCII Data<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <p>You use the FPRINTF function to write ASCII data to the instrument. For example, write a string to the echoserver.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(u, 'Request Time')</pre><p>By default, the FPRINTF function operates in a synchronous mode. This means that FPRINTF blocks the MATLAB command line until
         one of the following occurs:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>All the data is written</li>
         <li>A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By default the FPRINTF function writes ASCII data using the %s\n format. All occurrences of \n in the command being written
         to the instrument are replaced with the Terminator property value. When using the default format, %s\n, all commands written
         to the instrument will end with the Terminator character.
      </p>
      <p>For the previous command, the linefeed (LF) is sent after 'Request Time' is written to the instrument, thereby indicating
         the end of the command.
      </p>
      <p>You can also specify the format of the command written by providing a third input argument to FPRINTF. The accepted format
         conversion characters include: d, i, o, u, x, X, f, e, E, g, G, c, and s.
      </p>
      <p>For example, the display command 'Request Time' previously shown can be written to the instrument using two calls to FPRINTF.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(u, '%s', 'Request ');
&gt;&gt; fprintf(u, '%s\n', 'Time');</pre><p>The Terminator character indicates the end of the command and is sent after the last call to FPRINTF.</p>
      <h2>ASCII Write Properties -- OutputBufferSize<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>The OutputBufferSize property specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be written to the instrument at once. By default,
         OutputBufferSize is 512.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(u, 'OutputBufferSize')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>    512</pre><p>If the command specified in FPRINTF contains more than 512 bytes, an error is returned and no data is written to the instrument.</p>
      <h2>ASCII Write Properties -- ValuesSent<a name="7"></a></h2>
      <p>The ValuesSent property indicates the total number of values written to the instrument since the object was connected to the
         instrument.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(t, 'ValuesSent')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>   26</pre><p>Now, remove any data that was returned from the echoserver and captured by the UDP object.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; flushinput(u);</pre><h2>Reading ASCII Data<a name="8"></a></h2>
      <p>UDP sends and receives data in blocks that are called datagrams. Each time you write or read data with a UDP object, you are
         writing or reading a datagram. For example, a datagram with 13 bytes (12 ASCII bytes plus the LF terminator) is sent to the
         echoserver.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(u, 'Request Time');</pre><p>The echoserver will send back a datagram containing the same 13 bytes.</p>
      <p>You use the FSCANF function to read ASCII data from the instrument.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; data = fscanf(u)</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>Request Time</pre><p>By default, the FSCANF function reads data using the '%c' format and blocks the MATLAB command line until one of the following
         occurs:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>The terminator is received as specified by the Terminator   property (if DatagramTerminateMode is off)</li>
         <li>A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property</li>
         <li>The input buffer is filled</li>
         <li>The specified number of values is read (if   DatagramTerminateMode is off)</li>
         <li>A datagram has been received (if DatagramTerminateMode   is on)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also specify the format of the data read by providing a second input argument to FSCANF. The accepted format conversion
         characters include: d, i, o, u, x, X, f, e, E, g, G, c, and s.
      </p>
      <p>For example, the string '0.80' sent to the echoserver can be read into MATLAB as a double using the %f format string.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(u, '0.80')
&gt;&gt; data = fscanf(u, '%f')</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>     0.8000</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; isnumeric(data)</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>    1</pre><h2>ASCII Read Properties -- DatagramTerminateMode<a name="9"></a></h2>
      <p>The DatagramTerminateMode property indicates whether a read operation should terminate when a datagram is received. By default
         DatagramTerminateMode is on, which means that a read operation terminates when a datagram is received. To read multiple datagrams
         at once, you can set DatagramTerminateMode to off. In this example, two datagrams are written. Note, only the second datagram
         sends the Terminator character.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(u, '%s', 'Request Time');
&gt;&gt; fprintf(u, '%s\n', 'Request Time');</pre><p>Since DatagramTerminateMode is off, FSCANF will read across datagram boundaries until the Terminator character is received.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; set(u, 'DatagramTerminateMode', 'off')
&gt;&gt; data = fscanf(u)</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>Request TimeRequest Time</pre><h2>ASCII Read Properties -- InputBufferSize<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>The InputBufferSize property specifies the maximum number of bytes that you can read from the instrument. By default, InputBufferSize
         is 512:
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(u, 'InputBufferSize')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>    512</pre><h2>ASCII Read Properties -- ValuesReceived<a name="11"></a></h2>
      <p>The ValuesReceived property is updated by the number of values read from the instrument, including the terminator.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(u, 'ValuesReceived')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>    30</pre><h2>Cleanup<a name="12"></a></h2>
      <p>If you are finished with the UDP object, disconnect it from the instrument, remove it from memory, and remove it from the

% $Revision: 1.1.6.2 $  $Date: 2004/03/24 20:40:50 $

%% Introduction
% This demo explores ASCII read and write operations with a 
% UDP object. 
% 
% The information obtained for this demonstration was prerecorded.
% Therefore, you do not need an actual instrument to learn about ASCII read
% and write operations using a UDP object. The instrument used was an
% echoserver on a Linux O/S PC. An echoserver is a service available from
% the O/S that returns to the sender's address and port, the same bytes it
% receives from the sender.

%% Functions and Properties
% These functions are used when reading and writing text: 
% 
%  FPRINTF          - Write text to instrument.
%  FSCANF           - Read data from instrument and format as 
%                     text.
% 
% These properties are associated with reading and writing
% text:
% 
%  ValuesReceived   - Specifies the total number of values
%                     read from the instrument.
%  ValuesSent       - Specifies the total number of values 
%                     sent to the instrument.
%  InputBufferSize  - Specifies the total number of bytes 
%                     that can be queued in the input buffer
%                     at one time.
%  OutputBufferSize - Specifies the total number of bytes 
%                     that can be queued in the output buffer
%                     at one time.
%  Terminator       - Character used to terminate commands
%                     sent to the instrument.

%% Creating a UDP Object
% To begin, create a UDP object associated with the
% host name daqlab11, port 7. The host name is assigned by
% your network administrator. Port 7 is the port number for
% the echoserver.
% 
%  >> u = udp('daqlab11', 7);
%  >> u
% 
%    UDP Object : UDP-daqlab11
% 
%    Communication Settings
%       RemotePort:           7
%       RemoteHost:           daqlab11
%       Terminator:           'LF'% 
%  
%    Communication State 
%       Status:               closed
%       RecordStatus:         off
% 
%    Read/Write State  
%       TransferStatus:       idle
%       BytesAvailable:       0
%       ValuesReceived:       0
%       ValuesSent:           0

%% Connecting the UDP Object to the Instrument
% Before you can perform a read or write operation, you must
% connect the UDP object to the instrument with the FOPEN
% function. If the object was successfully connected, its
% Status property is automatically configured to open.
% 
%  >> fopen(u)
%  >> get(u, 'Status')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%  open
%

%% Writing ASCII Data
% You use the FPRINTF function to write ASCII data to the
% instrument. For example, write a string to the
% echoserver.
% 
%  >> fprintf(u, 'Request Time')
% 
% By default, the FPRINTF function operates in a synchronous
% mode. This means that FPRINTF blocks the MATLAB command line
% until one of the following occurs:
%
% * All the data is written
% * A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property
%
% By default the FPRINTF function writes ASCII data using 
% the %s\n format. All occurrences of \n in the command 
% being written to the instrument are replaced with the  
% Terminator property value. When using the default format,
% %s\n, all commands written to the instrument will end with 
% the Terminator character. 
% 
% For the previous command, the linefeed (LF) is sent after
% 'Request Time' is written to the instrument, thereby
% indicating the end of the command.
%
% You can also specify the format of the command written by 
% providing a third input argument to FPRINTF. The accepted 
% format conversion characters include: d, i, o, u, x, X, f, 
% e, E, g, G, c, and s.  
% 
% For example, the display command 'Request Time' previously
% shown can be written to the instrument using two calls to
% FPRINTF.
% 
%  >> fprintf(u, '%s', 'Request ');
%  >> fprintf(u, '%s\n', 'Time');
% 
% The Terminator character indicates the end of the command
% and is sent after the last call to FPRINTF.

%% ASCII Write Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH OutputBufferSize
% The OutputBufferSize property specifies the maximum number 
% of bytes that can be written to the instrument at once. 
% By default, OutputBufferSize is 512.  
% 
%  >> get(u, 'OutputBufferSize')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%      512
% 
% If the command specified in FPRINTF contains more than 512
% bytes, an error is returned and no data is written to the
% instrument.
% 

%% ASCII Write Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH ValuesSent 
% The ValuesSent property indicates the total number of values
% written to the instrument since the object was connected to
% the instrument.
% 
%  >> get(t, 'ValuesSent')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%     26
% 
% Now, remove any data that was returned from the
% echoserver and captured by the UDP object.
% 
%  >> flushinput(u);

%% Reading ASCII Data
% UDP sends and receives data in blocks that are called
% datagrams. Each time you write or read data with a UDP
% object, you are writing or reading a datagram. For
% example, a datagram with 13 bytes (12 ASCII bytes plus
% the LF terminator) is sent to the echoserver.
% 
%  >> fprintf(u, 'Request Time');
% 
% The echoserver will send back a datagram containing the
% same 13 bytes.
% 
% You use the FSCANF function to read ASCII data from the
% instrument.
% 
%  >> data = fscanf(u)
% 
%  data =
% 
%  Request Time
%
% By default, the FSCANF function reads data using the '%c' 
% format and blocks the MATLAB command line until one of the
% following occurs:  
%
% * The terminator is received as specified by the Terminator
%   property (if DatagramTerminateMode is off)
% * A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property
% * The input buffer is filled
% * The specified number of values is read (if
%   DatagramTerminateMode is off)
% * A datagram has been received (if DatagramTerminateMode
%   is on)
%
% You can also specify the format of the data read by 
% providing a second input argument to FSCANF. The accepted 
% format conversion characters include: d, i, o, u, x, X, f,
% e, E, g, G, c, and s.
% 
% For example, the string '0.80' sent to the echoserver can
% be read into MATLAB as a double using the %f format string.
% 
%  >> fprintf(u, '0.80')
%  >> data = fscanf(u, '%f')
% 
%  data = 
% 
%       0.8000
%  
%  >> isnumeric(data)
% 
%  ans =
% 
%      1
% 

%% ASCII Read Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH DatagramTerminateMode
% The DatagramTerminateMode property indicates whether a read
% operation should terminate when a datagram is received. By
% default DatagramTerminateMode is on, which means that a
% read operation terminates when a datagram is received. To
% read multiple datagrams at once, you can set
% DatagramTerminateMode to off. In this example, two datagrams
% are written. Note, only the second datagram sends the
% Terminator character.
% 
%  >> fprintf(u, '%s', 'Request Time');
%  >> fprintf(u, '%s\n', 'Request Time');
% 
% Since DatagramTerminateMode is off, FSCANF will read across
% datagram boundaries until the Terminator character is 
% received.
% 
%  >> set(u, 'DatagramTerminateMode', 'off')
%  >> data = fscanf(u)
% 
%  data =
% 
%  Request TimeRequest Time

%% ASCII Read Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH InputBufferSize
% The InputBufferSize property specifies the maximum number
% of bytes that you can read from the instrument. By default,
% InputBufferSize is 512:
% 
%  >> get(u, 'InputBufferSize')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%      512
% 

%% ASCII Read Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH ValuesReceived
% The ValuesReceived property is updated by the number of 
% values read from the instrument, including the terminator.
% 
%  >> get(u, 'ValuesReceived')
% 
%  ans =
%
%      30

%% Cleanup
% If you are finished with the UDP object, disconnect it from
% the instrument, remove it from memory, and remove it from the
% workspace.
% 
%  >> fclose(u);
%  >> delete(u);
%  >> clear u
