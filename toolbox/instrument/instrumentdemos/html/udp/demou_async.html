      <h2>Introduction<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>This demo explores asynchronous read and write operations with a UDP object.</p>
      <p>The information obtained for this demonstration was prerecorded. Therefore, you do not need an actual instrument to learn
         about asynchronous read and write operations using a UDP object. The instrument used was an echoserver on a Linux O/S PC.
         An echoserver is a service available from the O/S that returns to the sender's address and port, the same bytes it receives
         from the sender.
      </p>
      <h2>Functions and Properties<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>These functions are associated with reading and writing text asynchronously:</p><pre>FPRINTF        - Write text to instrument.
READASYNC      - Asynchronously read bytes from an instrument.
STOPASYNC      - Stop an asynchronous read and write operation.</pre><p>These properties are associated with ASCII read and write asynchronous operations:</p><pre>BytesAvailable - Indicate the number of bytes available in
                 the input buffer.
TransferStatus - Indicate what type of asynchronous operation
                 is in progress.
ReadAsyncMode  - Specify whether data is read continuously
                 in the background or whether you must call
                 the READASYNC function to read data
                 asynchronously.</pre><p>Additionally, you can use all callback properties during asynchronous read and write operations.</p>
      <h2>Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Operations<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>The object can operate in synchronous mode or in asynchronous mode. When the object is operating synchronously, the read and
         write routines block the MATLAB command line until the operation has completed or a timeout occurs. When the object is operating
         asynchronously, the read and write routines return control immediately to the MATLAB command line.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, you can use callback properties and callback functions to perform tasks as data is being written or read. For
         example, you can create a callback function that notifies you when the read or write operation has finished.
      </p>
      <h2>Creating a UDP Object<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>To begin, create a UDP object associated with the host name daqlab11, port 7. The host name is assigned by your network administrator.
         Port 7 is the port number for the echoserver.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; u = udp('daqlab11', 7);
&gt;&gt; u</pre><pre>  UDP Object : UDP-daqlab11</pre><pre>  Communication Settings
     RemotePort:           7
     RemoteHost:           daqlab11
     Terminator:           'LF'%</pre><pre>  Communication State
     Status:               closed
     RecordStatus:         off</pre><pre>  Read/Write State
     TransferStatus:       idle
     BytesAvailable:       0
     ValuesReceived:       0
     ValuesSent:           0</pre><h2>Connecting the UDP Object to Your Instrument<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <p>Before you can perform a read or write operation, you must connect the UDP object to the instrument with the FOPEN function.
         If the UDP object was successfully connected, its Status property is automatically configured to open.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fopen(u)
&gt;&gt; get(u, 'Status')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>open</pre><h2>Reading Data Asynchronously<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>You can read data asynchronously with the UDP object in one of these two ways:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Continuously, by setting ReadAsyncMode to continuous. In   this mode, data is automatically stored in the input   buffer as
            it becomes available from the instrument.
         </li>
         <li>Manually, by setting ReadAsyncMode to manual. In this   mode, you must call the READASYNC function to store data   in the
            input buffer.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The FSCANF, FREAD, FGETL, and FGETS functions are used to bring the data from the input buffer into MATLAB. These functions
         operate synchronously.
      </p>
      <h2>Reading Data Asynchronously -- Continuous ReadAsyncMode<a name="7"></a></h2>
      <p>To begin, read data continuously.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; set(u, 'ReadAsyncMode', 'continuous')</pre><p>Now, send a string to the echoserver.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(u, 'Hello net.')</pre><p>Because the ReadAsyncMode property is set to 'continuous', the object is continuously asking the instrument if any data is
         available.  The echoserver sends data as soon as it receives data. The data is then read from the instrument and is stored
         in the object's input buffer.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(u, 'BytesAvailable')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>    11</pre><p>You can bring the data from the object's input buffer into the MATLAB workspace with FSCANF.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; mystring = fscanf(u)</pre><pre>mystring =</pre><pre>Hello net.</pre><h2>Reading Data Asynchronously -- Manual ReadAsyncMode<a name="8"></a></h2>
      <p>Next, read the data manually.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; set(u, 'ReadAsyncMode', 'manual')</pre><p>Now, send a string to the echoserver.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(u, 'Hello net.')</pre><p>Once the last FPRINTF function completes, the instrument begins sending data. However, because ReadAsyncMode is set to manual,
         the object is not reading the data being sent from the instrument. Therefore no data is being read and placed in the input
         buffer.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(u, 'BytesAvailable')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>    0</pre><p>The READASYNC function can asynchronously read the data from the instrument. The READASYNC function returns control to the
         MATLAB command line immediately.
      </p>
      <p>The READASYNC function takes two input arguments. The first argument is the instrument object and the second argument is the
         SIZE, the amount of data to be read from the instrument.
      </p>
      <p>The READASYNC function without a specified SIZE assumes SIZE is given by the difference between the InputBufferSize property
         value and the BytesAvailable property value. The asynchronous read terminates when:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>The terminator is read as specified by the Terminator   property</li>
         <li>The specified number of bytes have been read</li>
         <li>A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property</li>
         <li>The input buffer is filled</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An error event will be generated if READASYNC terminates due to a timeout.</p>
      <p>The object starts querying the instrument for data when the READASYNC function is called. Because all the data was sent before
         the READASYNC function call, no data will be stored in the input buffer and the data is lost.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; readasync(u);
&gt;&gt; get(u, 'BytesAvailable')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>    0</pre><p>When the UDP object is in manual mode (the ReadAsyncMode property is configured to manual), data that is sent from the instrument
         to the computer is not automatically stored in the input buffer of the UDP object. Data is not stored until READASYNC or one
         of the blocking read functions is called.
      </p>
      <p>Manual mode should be used when a stream of data is being sent from your instrument and you only want to capture portions
         of the data.
      </p>
      <h2>Defining an Asynchronous Read Callback<a name="9"></a></h2>
      <p>Now, configure our UDP object to notify you when a terminator has been read.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; set(u, 'ReadAsyncMode', 'continuous')
&gt;&gt; set(u, 'BytesAvailableFcn', {'dispcallback'})</pre><p>Note, the default value for the BytesAvailableFcnMode property indicates that the callback function defined by the BytesAvailableFcn
         property will be executed when the terminator has been read.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(u, 'BytesAvailableFcnMode')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>terminator</pre><h2>The Callback Function<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>The M-file callback function DISPCALLBACK is defined below.</p><pre>function dispcallback(obj, event)

%
%    DISPCALLBACK(OBJ, EVENT) a callback function that displays

fprintf(['A ' event.Type ' event occurred for ' obj.Name ' at ' callbackTime '.\n']);</pre><h2>Using Callbacks During an Asynchronous Read<a name="11"></a></h2>
      <p>Now, echo a string from the instrument. Once the terminator is read from the instrument and placed in the input buffer, DISPCALLBACK
         is executed and a message is posted to the MATLAB command window indicating that a BytesAvailable event occurred.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fprintf(u, 'Hello net.')</pre><pre>A BytesAvailable event occurred for UDP-daqlab11 at 03-Mar-2002 12:57:55.</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; get(u, 'BytesAvailable')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>   11</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; data = fscanf(u)</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>Hello net.</pre><p>Note: the last value read is the linefeed (10):</p><pre>&gt;&gt; real(data)</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>    72   101   108   108   111    32   110   101   116    46    10</pre><h2>Stopping an Asynchronous Read Operation<a name="12"></a></h2>
      <p>Now suppose that halfway through the asynchronous read operation, you realize that the data being read from the instrument
         is incorrect. Rather than waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete, you can use the STOPASYNC function to stop the
         asynchronous read. Note that if an asynchronous write was in progress, the asynchronous write operation would also be stopped.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(u, {'TransferStatus','BytesAvailable'})</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>  'read'    [225]</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; stopasync(u);

         to bring this data into the MATLAB workspace. However, because this data represents the wrong data, the FLUSHINPUT function
         is called to remove all data from the input buffer.

      <p>You can perform an asynchronous write with the FPRINTF or FWRITE functions by passing 'async' as the last input argument.</p>
      <h2>Defining an Asynchronous Write Callback -- OutputEmptyFcn<a name="14"></a></h2>
      <p>For example, configure the object to notify you when an asynchronous write operation completes.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; set(u, 'OutputEmptyFcn', {'dispcallback'});

      <p>UDP sends and receives data in blocks that are called datagrams. Each time you write or read data with a UDP object, you are
         writing or reading a datagram. In the example below, a datagram with 11 bytes (10 ASCII bytes plus the LF terminator) will
         be sent to the echoserver. Then the echoserver will send back a datagram containing the same 11 bytes.
      </p>
      <p>Configure the object to notify you when a datagram has been received.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; set(u, 'DatagramReceivedFcn', {'dispcallback'});
&gt;&gt; fprintf(u, 'Hello net.', 'async')</pre><pre>A OutputEmpty event occurred for UDP-daqlab11 at 04-Mar-2002 17:52:29.
A DatagramReceived event occurred for UDP-daqlab11 at 04-Mar-2002 17:52:29.
A BytesAvailable event occurred for UDP-daqlab11 at 04-Mar-2002 17:52:29.</pre><h2>Stopping an Asynchronous Write Operation<a name="16"></a></h2>
      <p>If the STOPASYNC function is called during an asynchronous write operation, the asynchronous write will be stopped and the
         data in the output buffer will automatically be flushed. If an asynchronous read operation was also in progress, it would
         also be stopped. However, the data in the input buffer would not be flushed automatically.
      </p>
      <h2>Cleanup<a name="17"></a></h2>
      <p>If you are finished with the UDP object, disconnect it from the instrument, remove it from memory, and remove it from the
         workspace.

%% Introduction
% This demo explores asynchronous read and write operations
% with a UDP object.
% 
% The information obtained for this demonstration was prerecorded.
% Therefore, you do not need an actual instrument to learn about
% asynchronous read and write operations using a UDP object. The instrument
% used was an echoserver on a Linux O/S PC. An echoserver is a service
% available from the O/S that returns to the sender's address and port, the
% same bytes it receives from the sender.

%% Functions and Properties
% These functions are associated with reading and writing text
% asynchronously:
% 
%  FPRINTF        - Write text to instrument.
%  READASYNC      - Asynchronously read bytes from an instrument.
%  STOPASYNC      - Stop an asynchronous read and write operation.
% 
% These properties are associated with ASCII read and write 
% asynchronous operations:
% 
%  BytesAvailable - Indicate the number of bytes available in
%                   the input buffer.
%  TransferStatus - Indicate what type of asynchronous operation
%                   is in progress.
%  ReadAsyncMode  - Specify whether data is read continuously 
%                   in the background or whether you must call
%                   the READASYNC function to read data 
%                   asynchronously.
% 
% Additionally, you can use all callback properties during
% asynchronous read and write operations.

%% Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Operations
% The object can operate in synchronous mode or in asynchronous
% mode. When the object is operating synchronously, the read 
% and write routines block the MATLAB command line until
% the operation has completed or a timeout occurs. When the  
% object is operating asynchronously, the read and write
% routines return control immediately to the MATLAB 
% command line. 
% 
% Additionally, you can use callback properties and callback 
% functions to perform tasks as data is being written or
% read. For example, you can create a callback function that 
% notifies you when the read or write operation has finished.

%% Creating a UDP Object
% To begin, create a UDP object associated with the 
% host name daqlab11, port 7. The host name is assigned by   
% your network administrator. Port 7 is the port number for
% the echoserver.
% 
%  >> u = udp('daqlab11', 7);
%  >> u
% 
%    UDP Object : UDP-daqlab11
% 
%    Communication Settings
%       RemotePort:           7
%       RemoteHost:           daqlab11
%       Terminator:           'LF'% 
%  
%    Communication State 
%       Status:               closed
%       RecordStatus:         off
% 
%    Read/Write State  
%       TransferStatus:       idle
%       BytesAvailable:       0
%       ValuesReceived:       0
%       ValuesSent:           0

%% Connecting the UDP Object to Your Instrument
% Before you can perform a read or write operation, you must
% connect the UDP object to the instrument with the FOPEN 
% function. If the UDP object was successfully connected,
% its Status property is automatically configured to open. 
%
%  >> fopen(u)
%  >> get(u, 'Status')
%
%  ans =
%
%  open

%% Reading Data Asynchronously
% You can read data asynchronously with the UDP object 
% in one of these two ways: 
%
% * Continuously, by setting ReadAsyncMode to continuous. In
%   this mode, data is automatically stored in the input
%   buffer as it becomes available from the instrument.
% * Manually, by setting ReadAsyncMode to manual. In this
%   mode, you must call the READASYNC function to store data
%   in the input buffer.
% 
% The FSCANF, FREAD, FGETL, and FGETS functions are used to
% bring the data from the input buffer into MATLAB. These 
% functions operate synchronously.
% 

%% Reading Data Asynchronously REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH Continuous ReadAsyncMode
% To begin, read data continuously.
% 
%  >> set(u, 'ReadAsyncMode', 'continuous')
% 
% Now, send a string to the echoserver.
% 
%  >> fprintf(u, 'Hello net.')
% 
% Because the ReadAsyncMode property is set to 'continuous',
% the object is continuously asking the instrument if any data 
% is available.  The echoserver sends data as soon as it
% receives data. The data is then read from the instrument
% and is stored in the object's input buffer.
% 
%  >> get(u, 'BytesAvailable')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%      11
% 
% You can bring the data from the object's input buffer into 
% the MATLAB workspace with FSCANF.
% 
%  >> mystring = fscanf(u)
% 
%  mystring =
% 
%  Hello net.

%% Reading Data Asynchronously REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH Manual ReadAsyncMode
% Next, read the data manually.
% 
%  >> set(u, 'ReadAsyncMode', 'manual')
% 
% Now, send a string to the echoserver.
% 
%  >> fprintf(u, 'Hello net.')
% 
% Once the last FPRINTF function completes, the instrument 
% begins sending data. However, because ReadAsyncMode is set 
% to manual, the object is not reading the data being sent 
% from the instrument. Therefore no data is being read and 
% placed in the input buffer.  
% 
%  >> get(u, 'BytesAvailable')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%      0
%
% The READASYNC function can asynchronously read the data 
% from the instrument. The READASYNC function returns control
% to the MATLAB command line immediately.
% 
% The READASYNC function takes two input arguments. The first
% argument is the instrument object and the second argument is
% the SIZE, the amount of data to be read from the instrument.
% 
% The READASYNC function without a specified SIZE assumes SIZE
% is given by the difference between the InputBufferSize  
% property value and the BytesAvailable property value. The 
% asynchronous read terminates when: 
%
% * The terminator is read as specified by the Terminator
%   property
% * The specified number of bytes have been read
% * A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property
% * The input buffer is filled
% 
% An error event will be generated if READASYNC terminates due 
% to a timeout.
%
% The object starts querying the instrument for data when the
% READASYNC function is called. Because all the data was sent
% before the READASYNC function call, no data will be stored
% in the input buffer and the data is lost.
% 
%  >> readasync(u);
%  >> get(u, 'BytesAvailable')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%      0
% 
% When the UDP object is in manual mode (the ReadAsyncMode
% property is configured to manual), data that is sent from
% the instrument to the computer is not automatically
% stored in the input buffer of the UDP object. Data is
% not stored until READASYNC or one of the blocking read
% functions is called.
% 
% Manual mode should be used when a stream of data is being
% sent from your instrument and you only want to capture 
% portions of the data.

%% Defining an Asynchronous Read Callback
% Now, configure our UDP object to notify you when
% a terminator has been read.
% 
%  >> set(u, 'ReadAsyncMode', 'continuous')
%  >> set(u, 'BytesAvailableFcn', {'dispcallback'})
% 
% Note, the default value for the BytesAvailableFcnMode 
% property indicates that the callback function defined by the 
% BytesAvailableFcn property will be executed when the 
% terminator has been read.
% 
%  >> get(u, 'BytesAvailableFcnMode')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%  terminator 
% 

%% The Callback Function
% The M-file callback function DISPCALLBACK is defined below.
% 
%  function dispcallback(obj, event)
%  %DISPCALLBACK Display event information for the specified event.
%  % 
%  %    DISPCALLBACK(OBJ, EVENT) a callback function that displays  
%  %    a message which contains the type of the event, the name 
%  %    of the object which caused the event to occur and the 
%  %    time the event occurred.
%  %
%  %    See also INSTRCALLBACK.
% 
%  callbackTime = datestr(datenum(event.Data.AbsTime));
%  fprintf(['A ' event.Type ' event occurred for ' obj.Name ' at ' callbackTime '.\n']);

%% Using Callbacks During an Asynchronous Read
% Now, echo a string from the instrument. Once the terminator is read from
% the instrument and placed in the input buffer, DISPCALLBACK is executed
% and a message is posted to the MATLAB command window indicating that a
% BytesAvailable event occurred.
% 
%  >> fprintf(u, 'Hello net.')
% 
%  A BytesAvailable event occurred for UDP-daqlab11 at 03-Mar-2002 12:57:55.
% 
%  >> get(u, 'BytesAvailable')
%  
%  ans =
% 
%     11
% 
%  >> data = fscanf(u)
% 
%  data =
% 
%  Hello net.
% 
% Note: the last value read is the linefeed (10):
% 
%  >> real(data)
% 
%  ans =
% 
%      72   101   108   108   111    32   110   101   116    46    10

%% Stopping an Asynchronous Read Operation
% Now suppose that halfway through the asynchronous read
% operation, you realize that the data being read from
% the instrument is incorrect. Rather than waiting for the
% asynchronous operation to complete, you can use the 
% STOPASYNC function to stop the asynchronous read. Note 
% that if an asynchronous write was in progress, the 
% asynchronous write operation would also be stopped.
%
%  >> get(u, {'TransferStatus','BytesAvailable'})
%
%  ans = 
%
%    'read'    [225]
%
%  >> stopasync(u);
%  >> get(u, {'TransferStatus', 'BytesAvailable'})
%
%  ans = 
%
%    'idle'    [265]
%
% The data that has been read from the instrument remains in 
% the input buffer. You can use one of the synchronous read
% functions to bring this data into the MATLAB workspace.  
% However, because this data represents the wrong data, 
% the FLUSHINPUT function is called to remove all data 
% from the input buffer.  
%
%  >> flushinput(u);
%  >> get(u, {'TransferStatus', 'BytesAvailable'});
%
%  ans = 
%
%    'idle'    [0]


%% Writing Data Asynchronously
% You can perform an asynchronous write with the FPRINTF or
% FWRITE functions by passing 'async' as the last input 
% argument. 
% 

%% Defining an Asynchronous Write Callback REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH OutputEmptyFcn
% For example, configure the object to notify you when 
% an asynchronous write operation completes.  
% 
%  >> set(u, 'OutputEmptyFcn', {'dispcallback'});
%  >> fprintf(u, 'Hello net.', 'async')
% 
%  A OutputEmpty event occurred for UDP-daqlab11 at 03-Mar-2002 13:06:06.
%  A BytesAvailable event occurred for UDP-daqlab11 at 03-Mar-2002 13:06:06.

%% Defining an Asynchronous Write Callback REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH DatagramReceivedFcn
% UDP sends and receives data in blocks that are called
% datagrams. Each time you write or read data with a UDP
% object, you are writing or reading a datagram. In the
% example below, a datagram with 11 bytes (10 ASCII bytes
% plus the LF terminator) will be sent to the echoserver.
% Then the echoserver will send back a datagram containing
% the same 11 bytes.
% 
% Configure the object to notify you when a datagram
% has been received.
% 
%  >> set(u, 'DatagramReceivedFcn', {'dispcallback'});
%  >> fprintf(u, 'Hello net.', 'async')
% 
%  A OutputEmpty event occurred for UDP-daqlab11 at 04-Mar-2002 17:52:29.
%  A DatagramReceived event occurred for UDP-daqlab11 at 04-Mar-2002 17:52:29.
%  A BytesAvailable event occurred for UDP-daqlab11 at 04-Mar-2002 17:52:29.

%% Stopping an Asynchronous Write Operation
% If the STOPASYNC function is called during an asynchronous 
% write operation, the asynchronous write will be stopped
% and the data in the output buffer will automatically be
% flushed. If an asynchronous read operation was also in
% progress, it would also be stopped. However, the data
% in the input buffer would not be flushed automatically.

%% Cleanup
% If you are finished with the UDP object, disconnect
% it from the instrument, remove it from memory, and remove
% it from the workspace.
% 
%  >> fclose(u);
%  >> delete(u);
%  >> clear u
