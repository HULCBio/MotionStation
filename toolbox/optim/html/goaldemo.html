      <h1>Multiobjective goal attainment optimization</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>This demo shows how the Optimization Toolbox can be used to solve a pole-placement problem using the multiobjective goal attainment
            method.
         </p>
      </introduction>
      <p>Consider here a 2-input 2-output unstable plant.</p><pre class="codeinput">A =  [ -0.5  0  0;  0  -2  10;  0  1  -2 ];

B =  [ 1  0;  -2  2;  0  1 ];

C =  [ 1  0  0;  0  0  1 ];
</pre><p>Suppose we wish to design an output feedback controller, x, to have poles to the left of the location [-5, -3, -1] in the
         complex plane. The controller must not have any gain element exceeding an absolute value of 4.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">goal = [-5, -3, -1]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
goal =

    -5    -3    -1

</pre><p>Set the weights equal to the goals to ensure same percentage under- or over-attainment in the goals.</p><pre class="codeinput">weight = abs(goal)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
weight =

     5     3     1

</pre><p>Initialize output feedback controller</p><pre class="codeinput">x0 = [ -1 -1; -1 -1];
</pre><p>Set upper and lower bounds on the controller</p><pre class="codeinput">lb = repmat(-4,size(x0))
ub = repmat(4,size(x0))
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
lb =

    -4    -4
    -4    -4


ub =

     4     4
     4     4

</pre><p>Set optimization display parameter to give output at each iteration:</p><pre class="codeinput">options = optimset(<span class="string">'Display'</span>,<span class="string">'iter'</span>);
</pre><p>Create a vector-valued function eigfun that returns the eigenvalues of the closed loop system.  This function requires additional
         parameters (namely, the matrices A, B, and C); the most convenient way to pass these is through an anonymous function:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">eigfun = @(x) sort(eig(A+B*x*C))
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
eigfun = 

    @(x) sort(eig(A+B*x*C))

        fgoalattain(eigfun,x0,goal,weight,[],[],[],[],lb,ub,[],options);
