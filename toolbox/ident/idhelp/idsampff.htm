<title>Setting the Time Span for Model Fit</title>
Enter the lower and upper limits for the time span for which the fit between measured and predicted/simulated outputs is to be calculated. <p>

The default uses all samples in the Validation Data set, which can also be obtained by entering the empty matrix.<p>

It might sometimes be useful to exclude the transient from the comparison.<p>

When the validation data is changed, the default choice of time span is automatically restored.
