<center><h3>Parametric Models</h3></center>
The Parametric Models dialog is opened by chosing the corresponding 
item in the pop-up menu Estimate in the ident window.<p>
The dialog box gives access to all parametric modeling in the toolbox 
and operates on the Working Data set in the main ident window.<p>

<b>Usage:</b>First, choose a model structure using the pop-up menu. Then 
enter the orders of the model in the Orders: edit box, and hit the 
Return key. Possibly change the default Model name.  
Finally press the Estimate button to perform the estimation and 
enter the resulting model into the Model board.<P> 
The model structures supported by the dialog include:
<dl>
<dt><b><a href="iduiarx.htm">ARX</a></b>
        <dd>The simplest model structure that is often a first choice.
        Enter in Order field: na nb nk, the orders and input delays.
<dt><b><a href="iduiio.htm">ARMAX, OE, BJ</a></b> 
<dd>Covers a wide family of noise models for single output systems.
Enter in Order field numerator and denominator orders. If you are uncertain about the 
interpretation, use the Order Editor
<dt><b><a href="iduiss.htm">State Space</a></b>  
<dd>General linear state-space models.
Enter in Order field the state space order. Optionally you may also enter the input
delays within brackets. With the N4SID choice the order may be a range (like 1:10)
which allows you to choose
the order from a plot.
<dt><b><a href="iduibn.htm">By Initial Model</a></b>  <dd>Uses an 
arbitrary model structure created by 
previous estimation or by special Toolbox commands.
<dt><b><a href="idprocest.htm">Process Models</a></b> <dd>
Simple time-continuous process models are handled by another dialog. Choose 'Process Models...'
in the Estimation pop-up menu.

<dl>
<dt><b>Focus</b>
<dd> Offers the choices Prediction, Estimation, Filter, and Stability. 
<dl>
<dt>'Prediction' <dd>gives
a standard prediction error estimation method. This has optimal statistical
properties but from an approximation point,it typically favors a model fit
 at high frequencies. 
 <dt>'Simulation' <dd>approximates the dynamics of the model
(the transfer function from measured inputs to outputs) in a norm that is given by
the input spectrum. For the noise model, a prediction error method is used, while
the dynamics model is kept constant. 
<dt>'Filter' <dd>gives an additional weighting for
the dynamics model fit, by the frequency contents of a user defined filter. When
this option is chosen, a filter dialog window opens and you can design standard
Butterworth filters that are used for the model fit.
<dt>'Stability' <dd>forces the identified model to be stable.
</dl>
<dt><b>Disturbance Model</b>
<dd> If a model is written as a transfer function y = G u + H e, the rational
funtion H is the disturbance model.<p> For ARX, ARMAX, OE and BJ models, this field
indicates whether a disturbance model is estimated  or fixed to 1 ('No disturbance model.').
<p>
For State-space models there is an option between estimating a noise model, which
corresponds to the (Kalman gain) matrix K, or to fix it to zero, which gives H = 1.

<dt><b>Initial State</b>
<dd> The models require certain initial signal values to compute model outputs, the
initial state. For systems with slowly decaying responses, it may be very important
to handle these initial states in a good way. The popupmenu gives you the
following options:
<dl>
<dt>Auto</dt>
<dd> This is the default. An automatic choice between the alternatives below is
made, guided by the data properties.
<dt>Zero</dt>
<dd> All necessary initial values are taken as zero.
<dt>Estimate</dt>
<dd> The unknown intial values are treated as parameters, which are estimated.
<dt>Backcast</dt>
<dd>The initial values are estimated directly with a backwards filtering method
due to T. Knudsen.
</dl>
<dt><b>Covariance</b>
<dd> Covariance = 'Estimate' is the default and normal choice. The the uncertainty of the
estimated model will also be computed, and the confidence region of any <tt>Model View</tt> will also
be diplayed whan asked for in the Options menu. For large models, the handling of
uncertainty meausures may dominate the computation time.<br>
Covariance = 'None' suppresses the estimation and handling of uncertainty measures. In particular for
high order N4SID models this may be a useful option.
 <title> Order Selection and Order Editor </title>
<a name="order">
<center><h3>Order selection and Order editor</h3></center>
<dl>

<dt><b>Order editor... </b>
<dd>Opens a dialog box that allows easy definition of the chosen 
model structure. Also provides detailed help about the various model structures.
<dt><b>Order selection</b>
<dd>The order selection feature is available for state-space models, estimated
using N4SID, and for single-output ARX models using the ARX option. 
Pushing this button fills out the Order field with default order ranges. 
Then push Estimate, and a special plot will open where models of different
 orders can be selected by clicking.
  <title>Iteration Information</title>
<a name="iter">
<center><h3>Iteration Information</h3></center>
<dl>

<dt><b><a href="iduiiter.htm">Iteration control...</a></b>
 <dd>When applicable, opens a dialog box which provides information about 
the progress of iterative estimation algorithms.  It also provides access 
to several options which govern the iterative process.
</dl><p>
<dl>
<dt>NOTE 1: <dd>The ARX and State Space options allow many models to 
be generated simultaneously.  Simply define the orders to be vectors using 
the : operator.

<dt>NOTE 2: <dd>The Orders: edit box can accept a variable name from the 
MATLAB workspace. 
The variable must either contain valid orders or be an IDMODEL object.

<dt>NOTE 3: <dd>The available options and orders are automatically adjusted 
to the number of inputs and outputs in the selected working data set.
