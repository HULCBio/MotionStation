<title>Resampling</title>
The Resampling dialog is opened by chosing the corresponding item in the pop-up menu Preprocessing in the ident window.
<p> You can resample the Working Data set to any new sampling interval by interpolation and decimation. Proper prefiltering is automatically applied.<p>

The resampling factor, K, must be a positive number.  The new sampling interval will be K times the original one. K larger than 1 thus corresponds to decimation, while K less than 1 gives interpolation. See the command IDRESAMP for further information.<p>

Enter any string in the Data name: edit box. <p>

Press Insert to insert the resampled data into the ident window.
