<TITLE> Preprocessing Data </TITLE>
<center><h3>Preprocessing Data</h3></center>
The pop-up menu Preprocess provides several options for creating new data sets 
by modifying the Working Data set. 
The new data sets will be inserted into the <a href="idmw.htm#datamod">Data board</a>.
The list of options depends on whether the Working Data is time-domain, frequency-domain
or a frequency function. (Marked by white, light green and light brown background colors,
respectively).
<dl>
<dt><a href="idselio.htm">Select channels...</a>
<dd>Allows you to select a subset of the input and output channels of the data set.
The numbering of the inputs and outputs will be consistent throughout all data sets
created from an original set.

<dt><a href="idselexp.htm">Select Experiments...</a>
<dd>If the data set contains several experiments, this option allows you to
select subsets of the experiments. (Not for frequency function data.)

<dt><a href="idmergeexp.htm">Merge Experiments...</a>
<dd>Allows you to merge data sets into multi-experment sets. This may be useful
when you what to use more data to estimate a model, but the data sets have been
optained at different occasions so they cannot just be concatenated.
(Not for frequency function data.)

<dt><a href="idsel.htm">Select range...</a>
<dd>Allows you to select portions of the data set to be used for estimation and 
validation purposes. (Only for time domain data)

<dt>Remove means
<dd>Removes the mean values from both the input and output sequences.
(Only for time domain data)

<dt>Remove trends
<dd>Estimates and removes a linear trend from the input and output signals. 
For more information, see the MATLAB help on the DETREND function. (Only for time-domain data.)

<dt><a href="idfilt.htm">Filter...</a>
<dd>Allows you to prefilter the data set.
<dt><a href="iddec.htm">Resample...</a>
 <dd>Allows you to change the sampling interval, by interpolation and 
       decimation.
<dt>
<a href="trf.htm">Transform Data...</a>
<dd>Allows you to transform to frequency function data and between time and
frequency domain data.
<dt>
Quick start
<dd>Creates three new data sets from the Working Data set. 
First the mean values are removed, then the new data is split into two halves,
the first half becomes the new Working Data set, and the second half becomes the
new Validation Data set. Quick start also opens the plot window. (For multiexperiment data
no split of estimation/validation data is made.)
