<title>Merging Experiments</title>
To merge experiments, choose the item 'Merge Experiments ...' in the Preprocessing
pop-up menu.<p>

Then drag the data sets to be merged to the dialog box and drop them onto the
indicated white rectangle. A list of sets to be merged will also be generated.<P>

Enter a name for the merged data set in the edit box 'Data name'.<P>

When you press Insert, a multiexperiment IDDATA object will be created that contains all the
listed data sets as separate experiments. The property 'ExperimentName' will be taken
from the names of the individual sets. These have to be different. To change a data
name before merging, double click on it and enter a new name in the dialog box that
opens up.
<P>
Pressing the Revert button will erase the list of data sets chosen so far.
<P>
To work with multiple experiment data set has the following features:
<br>
In all relevent plots, a menu item 'Experiment' will allow you to choose which experiment to
study. <br>
When estimating models all the data will be used, with special measured taken when
the sets are concatenated, to avoid transient effects.
<p>
The usefulness of multiple experiments is when data has been collected at different 
occasions, or when a data set has been split up to remove 'bad' portions.
