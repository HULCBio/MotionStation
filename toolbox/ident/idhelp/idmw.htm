<TITLE> The Ident Window </TITLE>
<center><h3>The Ident Window</h3></center>
<b>Ident</b> is the graphical user interface to the System
    Identification
 Toolbox. Within the ident window  you can manage all the main
    activities
 of the identification process. You can also keep a detailed visual 
record of the data sets and models you have created. This is achieved
 by the ident window's menus, pop-up menus and check boxes, as well as
 by dragging and dropping the model/data icons.<p>

<b>Control actions </b><br>
You can control the identification session by a number of actions that 
      are all reached from the various controls in this main window:
<ul>
<li>
<A Href="#menus">The Menus</A>

<A Href="#popup">The Pop-up menus </A>

The main Ident window has four menus at the menu bar:

<A Href="idimp.htm#sess">session</A> control.

 to create extra model/data boards and to save  several settings

<TITLE> The Ident Window Pop-up Menus </Title>
<A NAME="popup">
<center><h3>The Ident Window Pop-up Menus</h3></center>
The main Ident window has four pop-up menus that control data and
    model
 imports, and the creating of new models and data sets. They are
    labeled as follows:<p>
<dl>
<dt><b><A href="idimp.htm#data">Data</A></b><dd>This menu allows
	direct import of data sets.
<dt><b><A href="idimp.htm#model">Model</A></b><dd>This menu allows
	direct import of models.
<dt><b><A href="iddatprp.htm">Preprocess</A></b><dd>This menu
 contains several options for creating data sets from the 
<a href="#workval">working data</a> by  preprocessing, like filtering,
 detrending, etc.
<dt><b><A href="idestm.htm">Estimate</A> </b><dd>This menu controls
	the  estimation of  models from the 
<a href="#workval">working data</a>.

<TITLE> The Ident Window Data and Model Boards </Title>
<A NAME="datamod">
<center><h3>The Data and Model Boards</h3></center>
The ident window contains 8 (16) positions for data set (model) icons.
 The <a href="sitbgui.htm#vieww">view windows</a> show the properties
    of the <b>selected</b> models and data sets.<p>
Data sets and models are selected by clicking on their icons.
      Selected objects are marked by a thick line in the
      icon. Clicking again deselects the object. Any number of objects 
      can be selected at the same time. The icons can be freely moved
 around by dragging-and-dropping using the
      mouse. <b>Double-clicking</b> (right mouse button) an icon opens
 a dialog that provides details about how the data set or model was
 generated, and also allows you to look at the model parameters
 (press the Present button). <p>
Extra Data/model boards can be opened as an Option in the ident
      window.
 This can be used both to accommodate more models/data sets and to
      allow a better layout and structure of the created objects.<p>
The contents of the model and data boards (a session) can be saved and
 reloaded using submenus of the File menu. Data sets and models are
 deleted by dragging them to the <a href="#trash">Trash</a>. <p>

Note that data and models do not automatically produce variables in
      the
 MATLAB workspace. To apply regular MATLAB commands to them, first
      export
 them to the workspace by dragging-and-dropping them on the
 <a href="#export">To Workspace icon</a>.<p>
 There are three kinds of data sets that are indicated by different background colors.
 <dl>
 <dt>Time domain input-output data: White background
 <dt>Frequency domain input-output data: Light green background
 <dt>Frequency function data: Light brown background.

<TITLE> Working and Validation Data </Title>
<A NAME="workval">
<center><h3>Working and Validation Data</h3></center>
All new data sets and all models are formed from the <b>Working
      data</b>. This is the data set shown at the center or the ident
    window. Drag and drop any data set to this position to make it the
    working data.
<p>All dialogs that depend on the working data will automatically be 
adjusted to the new set.
<p> The two model views Model Output and Model Residuals are results
      of applying the model to a certain data set. This data set is
      the <b>Validaton Data</b>, shown below the model view check
      boxes in the ident window. Drag and drop any data set to this
      position to make it the validation data.
<p> It is good practice to let the validation data be different from
      the working data, which the model was estimated from. The
      Quickstart item of the preprocess pop-up menu gives a default
      split of a data set into working and validation data.

<TITLE> Exporting Data and Models </Title>
<A NAME="export">
<center><h3>Exporting Data and Models</h3></center>
The data sets and models created by <b>ident</b> are normally not
 MATLAB workspace variables. To further work with them in command line 
    mode, export them to the workspace by dragging and dropping their
    icon to the <b>To Workspace</b> icon in the ident window.<p>
Note that models deliverad as IDMODEL and IDFRD objects, and you work with
      them with commands like <b>bode, step, ssdata, tfdata, zpkdata,
	d2c</b>, etc. See the manual. The objects can also be
      trasformed into the LTI objects of the Control Systems Toolbox
      by <b>tf, ss, zpk.</b>
<p> Note also that information about the model or data set is
      automatically exported along with the variable, as part of the
      object. 
Example: Export the model <tt>mymodel</tt> to workspace.
 The do the following commands:<br><tt>
mycmodel = d2c(mymodel); % Transforming it to cont. time. <br>
 </tt>
If you now import back mycmodel into ident, it will carry the correct 
notes and diary.

<title>Deleting Models and Data Sets</title>
<a name="trash">
<center><h3>Deleting Models and Data</h3></center>
Delete a model or data set by dragging and dropping it over the Trash
    Can icon.All plots associated with the variable will then also be
 deleted.<p>
Double-click on the Trash Can (right mouse button) to open it. Its
      contents
 can be dragged back to the data and model boards. 
<p>If you empty the Trash can (also an option under the Options menu
      in the ident window), its contents is permanently deleted.<p>
If you close an extra model/data board that is not empty, its contents
 will be put in the Trash can.
