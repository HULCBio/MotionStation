<title>Selecting the Auxilary Order</title>
The plot shows the fit as a function of the auxiliary order for the subspace state-space identification method N4SID.<p>

The fit is the sum of squared prediction errors when evaluated for the model using the Working Data set. The sum is divided by the number of data.<p>

The order corresponding to the lowest value of the fit - marked by a red bar - is automatically inserted into the Model board.
