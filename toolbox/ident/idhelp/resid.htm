<title>Model Residuals</title>
The Model Residual Plot is opened by checking the corresponding check box in the ident window.<p>
The plots show a residual analysis of the selected models.<p>

For each of the models, the residuals (prediction errors) are computed for
the data selected as the Validation Data set. 
<p> <b>For Time Domain Validation Data</b>, the autocorrelation function 
for the residuals as well as the cross correlation function between input 
and residuals are computed and displayed. The confidence interval for these 
functions is shown by default as dashed lines, and can
be turned off using the appropriate Options submenu. Ideally for an acceptable
model, the correleation curves should lie between these lines.<p>
<P> <b>For Frequency Domain Validation Data</b>, the estimated power spectrum
of the residuals is shown, as well as amplitude plot of the transfer function
from input to the residuals. Also in this case the upper and lower confidence
intervals of these estimates are shown as dashed lines. The interpretation is
that for the transfer function estimate, the confidence interval should contain
zero (i.e. the lower confidence line should be "below zero") to indicate an
acceptable model. Frequency regions where this is not the case indicate
regions where the model apparently not have captured all information in the
data. Correspondingly, for white residuals, it should be possible to
draw a straight line within the confidence interval or the power spectral
plot. (For IDFRD validation data, the confidence intervals may be misleading,
depending on the amount of data compression in the IDFRD data set.)
