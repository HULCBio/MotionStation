<title>Help: Select Range</title>
The Select Ranges dialog is opened by chosing the corresponding item in the pop-up menu Preprocessing in the ident window.<p>

<b>1.</b> Select a data range by either: <br>
    a) Typing lower and upper limits to the Time span: edit box,<br>
    b) Typing in lower and upper indices to the Samples: edit box,<br>
        Example:  4  6<br>
        Note: Do not use brackets or colons.<br>
    c) Clicking-and-draging a rectangle in either plot.<p>

<b>2.</b> Enter any string in the Data name: edit box. <p>

<b>3.</b> When you are satisfied with the time range, press Insert to insert the data into the Data board.<p>

Press Revert once to remove the most recently drawn time range outline. Press Revert again to delete all range outlines.<p>

The plot in the dialog shows the Working Data set.  For multi-input multi-output data sets the input-output pair is chosen using the Channel menu.<p>

The output is the upper plot, and the input is the lower plot. The input is plotted so that it is piecewise constant between the sampling instants. This can be changed to linear interpolation by selecting Regular input from the Style menu. <p>

The time scales are consistent with the information about sampling time and start time supplied when the data set was imported.
