 The Correlation Model dialog is opened by chosing the corresponding item
in the pop-up menu Estimate in the ident window.<p>
This function estimates the impulse response of the Working Data set using
high order FIR models (closely related to correlation analysis).
The result can be viewed by opening the Transient resp model View.<p>
The calculation is also obtained by pressing the hotkey <b> c </b> in the ident window. <p>
For the calculations, the input is first <a href="#prew">prewhitened</a> 
using an AR filter. The order of this filter (default 10) can chosen as an option in the dialog box.<p>

The algorithm is described in more detail under IMPULSE in the manual.<p>

 The Time Span over which the impulse reponse is calculated can be entered in the
 corresponding edit box. Negative lags may be useful to investigate any feedback
 effects in the input-output data. <p>The default time span is based on the number 
 entered under 'Time span' in the 'Options' pull-down menu in the 'Transient Response'
 Model View window.<p>

 
NOTE: This function cannot be applied to time series data (no input).<p>

<center><h3>Prewhitening for Correlation Model</h3></center>
The prewhitening filter is of the form A(q)u(t)=u_F(t), i.e., the input
u(t) (and output y(t)) is subjected to an FIR filter A to produce the
filtered signal u_F(t). The order of the prewhitening filter, N, is the order
(number of lags) of this filter A. The filter is determined by modeling
the input as an AR process of order N. The default value of N is 10.<p>

This default value is also obtained by leaving the corresponding  edit box empty.<p>
