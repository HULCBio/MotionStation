<title>Help: Transient Response</title>
The Transient response plot is opened by checking the corresponding check box in the ident window.<p>

The plots show the transient responses of selected models.<p>

Choose between displaying impulse and step responses using the checkmenus under the Options menu. <p>

For multi-input multi-output models, the input-output pair is chosen using the Channel menu. Note that you can inspect the response from noise channels, except for correlation models.
