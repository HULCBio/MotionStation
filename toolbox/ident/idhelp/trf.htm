<center><h3>Transform Data</h3></center>
The Transform Data dialog is opened by chosing the corresponding item in
the pop-up menu 'Preprocess' in the ident window.<p>
This function tranforms  the Working Data between the frequency and time domains and may
also provide a frequency function (IDFRD) data set.

<center><h4>Frequencies</h4></center>
When transforming to the Frequency function format, you may determine for which frequencies
the frequency function should be computed/estimated. These are determined by the popup-menu
'Frequency Spacing' and the edit box 'Number of Frequencies'. The frequencies are always in rad/s.
 <p>
 Choose linear or logarithmic spacing by the popup-menu, and enter the disired number of
 frequency values in the box <b>Number of Frequencies</b>. Then a frequency vector vector with this 
 number of points and this spacing is formed. The frequency span, for a time domain
 data set is from 0 (excluded) to the Nyquist frequency. For frequency domain data 
 it is between the smallest and largest frequencies in  the data set. 
 <p>
 The frequency resolution in this calculation is adjusted to the frequency spacing.
 This means that the default resolution in SPAFDR is used. (See HELP SPAFDR.)
