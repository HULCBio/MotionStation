<title>Options for Transient Response</title>
<b>Additional Options submenus:<hr>
<dl>
 <dt>Step response
 <dt>Impulse response</b>
    <dd>These mutually exclusive checkmenus choose which response to display.

 <dt><b>Number of samples</b>
    <dd>Opens a dialog to customize the number of response samples 
    calculated/displayed. For a discrete time model the sampling time 
    is clear. For a continuous time model, in this context, it is the
    sampling time of the data from which it was estimated. If not estimated,
    the sampling time is computed as a suitable sampling time given the
    dynamics of the model.<p>
    Note that an estimated impulse response (by "correlation model") may have
    to be reestimated for the range change to take place.

<b>Additional Style submenus:<hr>
<dl>
 <dt>Line plot
 <dt>Stem plot</b>
    <dd>These mutually exclusive checkmenus choose the character of the plot. For impulse responses, stem plots are often a good choice.
