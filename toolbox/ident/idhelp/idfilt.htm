<title>Prefilter Data</title>
The Filter dialog is opened by chosing the corresponding item in the
    pop-up menu Preprocessing in the ident window. The Filter dialog
    also
opens when you select the Filter option under <b>Focus</b> in the
    Parametric Models Dialog<p> 
The plot shows the input and output spectra for the chosen input-output
channel of the Working Data set.<p>
<b>1.</b> Select a frequency range by either: <br>
   a) Typing its lower and upper frequencies in the Range edit box,<br>
   b) Clicking-and-dragging a rectangle in either plot.<p>

<b>2.</b> Using the pop-up menu, specify whether the marked frequency
      range is a pass band or a stop band.<p> 
<b>3.</b> When you are satisfied with the frequency range, press
      Filter to compute the filtered data. Its spectra will be shown
      in the same plot to check that the filtering was successful. If
      you have multivariable data, you can at this point change
      channels in the plot window to check the filtering effect on the
      whole data set. The filter used is a 5th order Butterworth filter.
<p>
<b>4a.</b> In the <b>Preprocessing</b> case: When you are satisfied
      with the filtered data, enter any 
      string in the Data name: edit box and press Insert to insert it
      into the Data board. 
<p>
<b>4b.</b> In the <b>Focus: Filter</b> case: You cannot insert the
      data into the data board. The chosen filter will be used for
      internal filtering in the estimation algorithm. 
<p>
Press Revert to delete all the filtered plots.
<P>
A 5:th order Butterworth filter is used for the filtering.
