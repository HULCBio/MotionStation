<title>Options for Model Output</title>
<b>Additional Options submenus:</b><hr>
<dl>
 <dt><b>Simulated output
 <dt>K-step ahead predicted output</b>
    <dd>These mutually exclusive checkmenus determine how the model output should be calculated. Simulated output means simulate the model using the Validation Data set as input. The measured outputs are not used for the computation of the output.<br>
K-step ahead predicted output means compute a value of the output at sample number M using all inputs up to sample number M and all outputs up to sample number M-K.

<dt><b>Set prediction horizon</b>
    <dd>Sets the value K that determines the horizon (in samples).<br>
    The Other... submenu opens a dialog to customize the prediction horizon.
 <dt><b>Signal plot
 <dt>Error plot</b>
    <dd>These mutually exclusive checkmenus determine whether to plot the model output together with the measured output (Signal plot), or the differences between these signals (Error plot).



<dt><b>Customized time span for fit...</b>
    <dd>Opens a dialog to customize the time span over which the MSE fit is computed. By default, all samples are used. Changing the Validation Data set automatically reverts to this default.
