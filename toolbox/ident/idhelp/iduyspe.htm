<title>Data Spectra</title>
The Data Spectra Plot is opened by checking the corresponding check box in the ident window.<p>

The plot shows the spectra of the output and input signals of selected data sets. <p>

The method of computing/estimating the spectra is set using the Periodogram
and Spectral analysis mutually exclusive checkmenus under the Options menu.<p>
 When Spectral analysis is chosen, the method and resolution parameter is
 determined by the current choice under popup menu Estimate &gt Spectral model
 in the ident window. 
     Note that in this case only scalar resolution parameters are accepted for the SPAFDR
    case, and that the frequency range is always deternined from the plot windows's
    Options &gt Frequency range menu.<p>
The periodogram is the absolute square of the Fourier transform of the data
 sequence.
