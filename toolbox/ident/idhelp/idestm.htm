<center><h3>Estimating Models</h3></center>
The pop-up menu Estimate provides various methods for estimating models 
based on the Working Data set. The models will be inserted into the 
<a href="idmw.htm#datamod">Models board</a>.<p>
The pop-up has the following choices:
<dl>
<dt><a href="idparest.htm">Parametric models...</a>
<dd>Opens a dialog, which allows you to generate dynamic linear models with
different structures, orders, and delays. 
A model structure characterizes the relationship between input and output data
and between unknown noise sources and the output data. Supported model structures 
include ARX, ARMAX, Output Error (OE), Box-Jenkins (BJ), State-Space, and others.
<dt><a href="idprocest.htm">Process models...</a>
<dd>Opens a dialog, which allows you to simple continuous time dynamic linear models
characterized by Static gain, time constants and time delays.
 
<dt><a href="spa.htm">Spectral model...</a>
<dd>Estimates the system's frequency response from the data using either 
Fourier Transform techniques or the Blackman-Tukey approach.
<dt><a href="cra.htm">Correlation model...</a>
<dd>Estimates the system's transient response (impulse response) 
by correlating filtered versions of the input-output data. 
<dt>Quick start
<dd>Performs correlation analysis and spectral analysis. 
Computes a default ARX model with a delay heuristically determined based on the 
estimated impulse reponse of the system as well as a default order state-space model.
