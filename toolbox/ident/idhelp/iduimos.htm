<title>Help: Model Order Selection</title>
To select good model orders, there are two useful functions in ident.<p>
When they are available, a button <b>Order Selection</b> is visible in
      the Parametric Models window. Push that button for default order
      ranges.<p> 
<b>For ARX models</b> many models can be estimated simultaneously, and
      evaluated using the validation data. To achieve this, select
      Parametric Models in the Estimate pop-up menu in the ident
      window. Then for each required oder (na, nb, and nk) enter a
      vector, using MATLAB's colon notation. (You can also use the
      Order editor for this, or create the expression as a variable in
      the Command Window and enter the name of this variable in the
      Order box.)<p> 
When you press Estimate, models corresponding to all combinations of
      orders will be computed. These models will be evaluated using
      the validation data and their fit will be displayed in a special
      dialog window. Here you can select which model(s) to enter into
      the model board. This is a counterpart of ARXSTRUC and SELSTRUC
      in the command line use of the Toolbox. <p> 
<b>For state space models</b> many orders can be evaluated
      simultaneously using the N4SID method. Select the State-space
      model structure in the Parametric Models dialog. Just enter a
      vector (using MATLAB's colon notation) for the model order, and
      a plot that displays corresponding models' properties will be
      opened. Click in this plot to select which model(s) to insert
      into the model board.<p> 
See N4SID in the Command Reference Manual for more information.<p>
