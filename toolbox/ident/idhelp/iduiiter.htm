<title>Help: Iteration Information</title>
<center><h3>Iteration Information</h3></center>

The estimate is computed by iterative search for a model that gives the 
minimal prediction error variance, when applied to the working data.
The Parametric Model and the Process Model dialogs provide online information about the
progress of this search.<p>
The number of the current iteration is shown after 'Iteration #' together with the
current Fit (Loss function = the sum of squares of output prediction errors normalized by the
number of data; for multi-output models, it is the determinant of the covariance matrix of
the prediction errors).<p> The improvement in fit compared to the previous iteration is
also shown.<p>
If you check the box 'Trace', a full trace of loss functions, parameter values, and
update information is given in the MATLAB command window.<p>
Press 'Stop iterations' to stop the search and save the result after the current iteration
has been completed. Press 'Continue' to continue the iterations from the current model.

  <p>

The iterative search is controlled by a number of design variables that can be accessed by
pressing the
<a href="idioopt.htm">Iteration options...</a> button.
