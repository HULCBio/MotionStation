<title>Help: Noise Spectrum</title>
The Noise spectrum plot is opened by checking the corresponding check box in the ident window.<p>

The plots show the disturbance spectra of the selected models.<p>

For input-output models the disturbance spectrum is defined as the
spectrum of w in the description <p>

       y(t) = G(q) u(t)  +  w(t) <p>

For time series models <p>

       y(t) = H(q) e(t) <p>

the shown spectrum is that of y itself.<p>

The output number (channel) selector (y1, etc.) refers to the chosen output 
component of the spectrum. Cross spectra between different outputs are not 
accessible.
