<title>Help: Spectral Model</title>
<center><h3>Spectral Models</h3></center>
The Spectral Model dialog is opened by chosing the corresponding item in
the pop-up menu Estimate in the ident window.<p>
This function estimates the frequency response of the Working Data 
set using spectral analysis. Open the Frequency response model View to see the results.<p>
The spectral model is also calculated if you press the hotkey <b>s</b> in the ident window.<p>

<center><h4>Methods</h4></center>
The dialog offers a choice of three methods:
<dl>
<dt><b> SPA (Blackman-Tukey)</b>
<dd>This is the classical spectral analysis method, where  windowed versions of the
covariance functions are Fourier transformed. It corresponds to the command line method SPA.
<dt><b> SPAFDR (SPectral Analysis with Frequency Dependent Resolution.)</b>
<dd>Fourier transforms of the outputs and inputs are first formed. Products of the inputs and
outputs with the conjugate input transform are smoothed over local frequency regions, whose
width may depend on the frequency. It corresponds to the command line method SPAFDR.
<dt><b>ETFE (Emprical Transfer Function Estimate</b>
<dd>This is the Empirical Transfer Function Estimate, which in the raw form is the ratio of
the output Fourier transform to the input one. If corresponds to the command line method
ETFE.
</dl>
<a name="freq">

<center><h4>Frequencies</h4></center>

The estimate is computed at frequencies that are determined by the popup-menu
'Frequency Spacing' and the edit box 'Frequencies'. The frequencies are always in rad/s.
Two ways are possible:
<dl><dt>1. Direct<dd>
 Enter the frequency vector in the box <b>Frequencies</b>. This could be any MATLAB
 expression that evaluates to a vector, like 'logspace(-1,2,500)', or the name of
 any Workspace variable that is a vector. In this case the 'Frequency Spacing' menu has no
 effect.
 <dt>2. Indirect<dd>
 Choose linear or logarithmic spacing by the popup-menu, and enter the disired number of
 frequency values in the box <b>Frequencies</b>. Then a frequency vector vector with this 
 number of points and this spacing is formed. The frequency span, for a time domain
 data set is from 0 (excluded) to the Nyquist frequency. For frequency domain data 
 it is between the smallest and largest frequencies in  the data set. 
<dt> <b>Note for ETFE:</b> <dd>For the EFTE method only linearly spaced frequencies are possible.
Only the number of frequency points can be specified, and they will then be linearly spaced up
to the Nyquist frequency.
   </dl>

<a name="resol">

<center><h4>Resolution</h4></center>

By 'resolution' is meant the finest detail in the frequency response that can be detected.
A resolution of 0.1 rad/s means that peaks and details that differ with less then 0.1 rad/s
will not be seen.<p>
There is a trade-off between frequency resolution and uncertainty 
of the estimate: The better the resolution, the more uncertain estimate. This
trade-off is controlled by the frequency resolution parameter, entered in the 
<b>Frequency Resolution</b> box.
The interpretation
of this depends on the method used:
<dl>
<dt>For SPA and ETFE<dd>
enter a scalar integer M.
It gives a frequency resolution of about pi/M rad/(sampling interval). 
The default choice of M - obtained by leaving the box empty - gives 
a reasonable choice for not-so-resonant systems for SPA and maximum resolution
for ETFE (no smoothing). <p>
<dt>For SPAFDR<dd>
enter either a number R that is the desired frequency resolution in rad/s
or a vector R of the same size as the frequency vector. Then R(k) is the resolution
around frequency(k). You may enter the name of a workspace variable that evaluates
to such a vector.<p>
or leave empty for default. The default is to let the resolution be twice the difference 
between the neigbouring frequencies. The resultion is thus determined by the frequency vector.
<b>Note that a scalar R is inversely related to the M used for SPA and ETFE</b>
