<p>
<code><strong>vrlights</strong></code> is an example with light sources. 
In the scene there are Sun (modeled as DirectionalLight) and Lamp (modeled as PointLight) moved around
from the Simulink model, creating the illusion of changes between day and night and night terrain illumination.
In the associated VRML file, several viewpoints are defined that allow you to observe gradual changes 
in light from various perspectives.
</p>

<p>
While the effect of moving light sources on the terrain is directly visible, the VRML world background doesn't
automatically reflect the current light sources status. Background color needs to be specifically changed 
depending on the Sun position. Here it is done using a VRMLScript. For details please view 
the associated VRML file <strong>vrlights.wrl</strong> in a text editor.
</p>

<p>
This example can be used for training user navigation and testing the use of navigation zones 
in various navigation modes.
