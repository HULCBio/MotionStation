<p>
In addition to the <a href="vrmaglev.html">vrmaglev</a> example, the 
<code><strong>vrmaglev_rtwin</strong></code> example works directly with the actual 
<a href="http://www.humusoft.com/models/ce152.htm">CE 152 scale model</a> hardware in real time. 
We created this model to work with <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/rtw">Real Time Workshop</a>, <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/rtwt">Real Time Windows Target</a>, 
and the HUMUSOFT <a href=" http://www.humusoft.com/datacq/ad512.htm">AD 512</a> data acquisition board. 
However, you can adapt this model for other targets and acquisition boards. 
A digital IIR filter, from the Signal Processing Toolbox, filters the physical system output. 
You can bypass the physical system by using the built-in plant model.
</p>

<p>
Running this model in real time is an example showing the capabilities of Simulink in control systems 
design and rapid prototyping. When you change the position of the virtual ball using your mouse, 
the real ball follows the position you set. When you push the real ball up or down against 
the coil force, the position of the virtual ball changes in the virtual world. 
If you remove the ball from the real system, the ball also disappears from the virtual world.
</p>

<p>
It is important to realize the power of this virtual reality operator control concept. 
Instead of saying, "I want the ball at the position of 0.4" you can say "I want the object to be here",
and it goes there.
</p>

<p>
Note that after enabling the remote view in the VR Sink block dialog box, you can control the Simulink 
model even from a <strong>remote client computer</strong>. This can be useful for distributing the computing power between 
a real-time Simulink model running on one machine and the rendering of a virtual reality world on another machine.

<p><em>Note: This demo requires the following software and hardware components:
<ul>
	<li>Real Time Workshop</li>
	<li>Real-Time Windows Target</li>
	<li>CE 152 Magnetic Levitation scale model (optional).</li>
</ul>
