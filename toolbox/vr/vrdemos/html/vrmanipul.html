<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Manipulator Example with SpaceMouse</p>

<p>
This example illustrates the use of Virtual Reality Toolbox for virtual reality prototyping 
and testing the viability of designs before the implementation phase. Also, this example illustrates 
the use of the <a href="http://www.3dconnexion.com/products/Classic.htm">Magellan SpaceMouse</a> 
for manipulating objects in a virtual world.

<p>
The VRML model represents a nuclear hot chamber manipulator. It is manipulated by a simple Simulink model 
containing the SpaceMouse Input block. This model uses all 6 degrees of freedom of the SpaceMouse 
for manipulating the mechanic arm, and mouse button 1 to close the grip of manipulator jaws. 
</p>

<p>
Magellan Space Mouse is an input device with 6 degrees of freedom. 
It is useful for navigating and manipulating objects in a virtual world. 
SpaceMouse is also suitable as a general input device for Simulink models. 
This professional 3-D device greatly facilitates all the above mentioned tasks, 
and we recommend you use it for higher performance applications and user comfort. 
SpaceMouse is supported through the <strong>SpaceMouse Input</strong> block which is included in the 
Virtual Reality Toolbox block library for Simulink. 
</p>

<p>
The Magellan SpaceMouse Input block can operate in three modes to cover the most typical use of such a device in 3-D context: 
<ul>
	<li>Speeds </li>
	<li>Positions </li>
	<li>Viewpoint coordinates </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<em>Note: This demo requires the SpaceMouse or compatible device 
(SpaceMouse Plus, SpaceMouse Plus XT, PuckMan).</em>
