<p><h1>About HTHELP</h1>

HTHELP is a hypertext help viewing utility.  It provides HTML viewing
capability from within MATLAB.  In addition to viewing any HTML files, one
can browse through the help text of the complete set of MATLAB Contents.m
and m-files.  It is a powerful complement to MATLAB's on-line help.  In
particular, it makes it much easier for writers of MATLAB GUI functions to
incorporate on-line help from within GUI applications.<p>

Hyper-Help parses a plain-text document for special markups (based on HTML)
which allow it to format the text properly, and allow the user to roam
through a series of documents.  In fact, the operation of HTHELP is very
similar to Mosaic and Netscape.<p>

This file you are reading is written using HTHELP's markup language.  The
file is in uitools/hthelp.html, if you wish to look at the source-text.<p>

Except for &lt; characters, HTHELP will work on plain ascii files without
any of <A HREF="#format">HTHELP's formatting codes</A>.  When used in this
way it provides a nice UI to display and <A HREF="#Caching">cache</A> long
text files.<p>

To use HTHELP from within an m-file, or anywhere, all that needs to be done
is to pass it the name of the HTML file to load.<p>

<A NAME="Commands">
If HTHELP is called with more than one argument, it acts differently.  This
is how the internal commands are accessed.  These are undocumented in the
m-file help.<p>

<A NAME="prev">
Calling HTHELP('prev', 0) reverts to the previous document.  If the user
has dismissed the window by pressing the "Done" button, this just makes the
figure visible with the last document still loaded.  If the figure is
visible, then it is just as if the user has pressed the PREVIOUS button.
(It stores up to the last 20 documents you have viewed as a stack.)<p>

Calling HTHELP with no arguments loads up the main help page of MATLAB.
Hyper-links are automatically built to all of the MATLAB main topics and
toolboxes.<p>

Calling HTHELP('cont', 'filename') loads up the specified file as a MATLAB
Content.m file.  This can be useful in displaying the contents of any
MATLAB directory.  Hyper-links are automatically built to the m-files
described in the Contents.m file 'filename'.  The Contents.m file must be
written in the proper MATLAB Contents.m file format.<p>

Calling HTHELP('func', 'mfilename') loads up the specified file as a MATLAB
m-file.  Hyper-links are automatically created to other related m-files.
These related function names are found after the 'See also' in the m-file
help text.<p>

Try >>hthelp with no arguments at the MATLAB prompt to see how the 'cont'
and the 'func' commands can be used to generate hyper-help across all of
MATLAB.<p>

<TITLE>Formatting HTHELP files</TITLE>
<A NAME="format">
<p><H1>Formatting HTHELP Files</H1>
The first time HTHELP loads a document, it parses it for markups which are
enclosed between a greater than and a less than symbol.  It also parsed for
escape sequences enclosed between the &amp; and ; symbols.  The markups
used in HTHELP are an extended subset of HTML, the markup language used by
Mosaic, Netscape and the World-Wide Web.  People familiar with HTML should
have no trouble with these commands.  Here are the recognized markups:<p>

<dl><dt>&lt;TITLE&gt;Section Title&lt;/TITLE&gt;
<dd>Begin and name a section.  Unlike other viewers, HTHELP allows more
than one section in the same file.  Every time a new title is specified,
HTHELP treats that section like a new document.<p>

<dt>&lt;A HREF="filename#optional_section_name"&gt;click here&lt;/A&gt;
<dd>Start a hyper-link reference.  This operates just as it does in HTML.
The code can be any of the <A HREF="#Codes">three types</A>.<p>

<dt>&lt;A NAME="section_name"&gt;New Section&lt;/A&gt;
<dd>Name a section.  This operates just as it does in HTML.  It is a marker
within a file.  This specifies the destination of a hyper-link.<p>

<dt>&lt;A RUN="MATLAB_command"&gt;bode(num, den)&lt;/A&gt; 
<dd>Run a MATLAB command.  This is an extension of HTML which executes the
callback from the hyper-link in the MATLAB command window.  Any MATLAB
command will work.  The string between the markups is simply passed to the
command line.<p>

<dt>&lt;B&gt;Bold text&lt;/B&gt;
<dd>Prints <b>bold</b> text.<p>

<dt>&lt;I&gt;Italic text&lt;/I&gt;
<dd>Prints <i>italic</i> text.<p>

<dt>&lt;TT&gt;Typewriter text&lt;/TT&gt;
<dd>Prints <tt>typewriter</tt> text.<p>

<dt>&lt;HR&gt;
<dd>Places a horizontal rule below the present line.<p>

<A NAME="Heading">
<dt>&lt;Hn&gt;Heading&lt;/Hn&gt;
<dd>Capital H followed by a number (1-4) sets a heading level.
H1 gives the largest heading.  H4 the smallest (but still larger
than the default text.)  /Hx resets font setting level x.<br>
</dl>
<H1>This is a level one <A HREF="#Heading">heading</A></h1>
<H2>This is a level two <A HREF="#Heading">heading</A></h2>
<H3>This is a level three <A HREF="#Heading">heading</A></h3>
<H4>This is a level four <A HREF="#Heading">heading</A></h4><p>

Markups can appear anywhere within a line.  The only restriction comes
from the way markers are stored internally: they are attached as tags
to the next text object created.  For this reason, multiple markers
without text in between do not all work.<p>
<hr>
<A NAME="Codes"><h1>Codes</h1>
Link-codes come in three styles.  The basic form is:
[filename][#marker]<br> Specifically, the variations are:<p>

1.  Filename codes
<dl><dd>These codes specify a file, but not a marker, such as "hthelp.hlp".
In this case, HTHELP just starts at the top of the document.</dl><p>
2.  Full codes
<dl><dd>These codes specify a file and a marker, such as "hthelp.hlp#Caching"</dl><p>
3.  Relative codes
<dl><dd>This kind of code, like "#Caching" assumes that the link is internal to
the same file.</dl><p>
Note that marker names can contain whitespace.<p>

<TITLE>Document Caching in HTHELP</TITLE>
<A NAME="Caching"><h3>Document Caching in HTHELP</h3>

HTHELP automatically caches loaded documents.  This means
that a document's text is only <A HREF="#format">parsed</A> once.  Once a
document is parsed, it is in the figure so that the next time that document
is requested, HTHELP merely needs to make it visible.<p>

<A NAME="Technical">Documents are displayed as static text on an axis.  The
axis contains information about where the document came from for caching
purposes.  Scrolling is accomplished by simply changing the axis's
y-limits.  When a document is cached, all the text objects are made
invisible.  When a document is requested, HTHELP scans all the existing
axes to see if any came from the requested file.  Then it searches each of
the ones which did for the exact marker.  If it is found, it is made
visible, otherwise the text is loaded and parsed into new axes.<p>

The cache is limited to 20 documents by default.  When the cache fills up,
it automatically removes the document which has not been accessed in the
longest amount of time.  Keep in mind that cache maintenance has some
overhead, so that very large caches will slow down normal operation.
(Specifically, removing an unused document from a full cache can be
slow.)<p>
