         <p>For any matrix X, IMAGE(X) displays a graphical image with brightness or color chosen from the elements of X used as indices
            into a colormap.  This demo illustrates this idea of representing a matrix as an image and in general displaying images stored
            as matrices.

      <h2>The simple spiral matrix<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>SPIRAL stores a simple sprial pattern into a matrix.  You can see the spiral pattern of the matrix elements in the figure.
          The elements of the matrix spiral away from the center, growing in magnitude linearly.  Small numbers (center values) are
         mapped to black and dark gray, while the larger values (around the edge of the matrix) are mapped to light gray and white.
          The assignment of small values of the matrix to black, large values of the matrix to white and intermediate values to shades
         of gray determines a color map.

      <p>COLORMAP function is used to change the color mapping.  The map had been set with colormap(gray) in the previous screen. 
         Here we change the colormap to hue-saturation-value (hsv) color map.  The colors begin with red, pass through yellow, green,
         cyan, blue, magenta, and return to red.

         of functions which return matrices.)  Color map matrices have three columns which specify intensities of the red, green and
         blue video components.  The number of rows depends upon the particular image.  In this example, the elements of X = spiral(8)
         range from 1 to 64, so we are using 64 rows.

</pre><p>The elements of X are used as indices into the color map and so X must have positive, integer elements between 1 and the length
         of the map.  To see how an individual color is determined, pick one element of X, say X(7,1).  The corresponding color map
         entry is M(37,:).  This has full intensity in the red gun, a little over half intensity in the green gun, and no blue.  It
         produces the shade of orange in the cell in the (7,1) position near the lower left corner.

         can be of any size, but its elements must be positive integers between 1 and m.  The matrix M should then have m rows, 3 columns,
         and elements between 0.0 and 1.0.  COLORMAP(M) also sets the colors used by PCOLOR(X), SURF(Z) and MESH(Z), but in these cases
         the data matrix, X or Z, is rescaled to provide indices into the color map.  A completely different feature of our spiral
         example is revealed by the 'flag' color map.  The 'flag' colormap is simply m/4 copies of the matrix flag(4), shown below,
         stacked on top of each other.  The colors red, white, blue and black are used cyclically as the elements of X vary and so
         finer details of the image data become apparent.  In this example, we can see the diagonal patterns in the matrix
