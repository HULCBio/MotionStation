      <introduction>
         <p>This is a demonstration of some aspects of the MATLAB language.</p>
      </introduction>
      <p>First, let's create a simple vector with 9 elements called <tt>a</tt>.

a =

</pre><p>Now let's add 2 to each element of our vector, <tt>a</tt>, and store the result in a new vector.
      </p>
      <p>Notice how MATLAB requires no special handling of vector or matrix math.</p><pre class="codeinput">b = a + 2

b =
