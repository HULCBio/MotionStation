%HORZCAT Horizontal concatenation.
%   [A B] is the horizontal concatenation of matrices A and B.  A and B
%   must have the same number of rows.  [A,B] is the same thing.  Any
%   number of matrices can be concatenated within one pair of brackets.
%   Horizontal and vertical concatenation can be combined together as in
%   [1 2;3 4].  
%
%   [A B; C] is allowed if the number of rows of A equals the number of
%   rows of B and the number of columns of A plus the number of columns
%   of B equals the number of columns of C.  The matrices in a
%   concatenation expression can themselves by formed via a
%   concatenation as in [A B;[C D]].  These rules generalize in a
%   hopefully obvious way to allow fairly complicated constructions.
%
%   N-D arrays are concatenated along the second dimension. The first and
%   remaining dimensions must match.
%
%   C = HORZCAT(A,B) is called for the syntax '[A  B]' when A or B is an
%   object.
%
%   Y = HORZCAT(X1,X2,X3,...) is called for the syntax '[X1 X2 X3 ...]'
%   when any of X1, X2, X3, etc. is an object.
