function delete(obj)
%DELETE Delete a COM object.
%  DELETE(OBJ) releases all interfaces derived from the specified
%  COM server or control, and then deletes the server or control itself.
%  This is different from releasing an interface, which releases and
%  invalidates only that interface.
%
%   Equivalent syntax is
%        OBJ.DELETE
