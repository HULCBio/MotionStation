      <h1>Measuring the Power of Deterministic Periodic Signals</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>This demonstration will focus on power signals, specifically deterministic periodic signals.  Although continuous in time,
            periodic deterministic signals produce discrete power spectrums.  For this reason we will use mean-square (power) to measure
            the signal's power at a specific frequency.
         </p>
         <p>We will provide two examples of how to measure a signal's average power. The examples will use sine waves and assume a load
            impedance of 1 Ohm.
         </p>

      <h2>Signal Classification<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>In general signals can be classified into three broad categories, power signals, energy signals, or neither.  Deterministic
         signals which are made up of sinusoids is an example of power signals which have infinite energy but finite average power.
          Random signals also have finite average power and fall into the category of power signals. Transient signals is an example
         of energy signals which start and end with zero amplitude. There are still other signals which can't be characterized as either
         a power or energy signal.
      </p>
      <h2>Theoretical Power of a Single Sinusoid<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>In our first example we'll estimate the average power of a sinusoidal signal with a peak amplitude of 1 volt and a frequency
         component at 128Hz.
