%NORMALIZE Normalize coefficients between -1 and 1.
%   G = NORMALIZE(Hd) normalizes the coefficients between -1 and 1 and
%   returns the gain G due to normalization.  Subsequent calls to NORMALIZE
%   will not change the coefficients and G will always return the gain used
%   in the first normalization.
