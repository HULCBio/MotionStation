The ASCII file

   MtWashington-ft.grd

contains a United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Digital 
Elevation Model (DEM) for the Mt. Washington quandrangle.  This data set
covers an area of roughly 14,000-by-10,000 meters in the White Mountains
of New Hampshire, USA, with elevations posted every 30 meters.  The data
are referenced to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), Zone 19, in the
North American Datum of 1927.  Horizonal units are meters and vertical
units are feet.  "No data" elements near the edge of the data grid have
a value of -32766.


Data Translation
----------------
This file was derived by translating an Spatial Data Transfer Standard
(STDS) Raster Profile data set to Arc ASCII Grid format.  The following
is from the self-documentation of the original SDTS data set:

Welcome!
This directory contains a Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS), 
Raster Profile (RP) compliant transfer, produced by the National
Mapping Division of the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

PURPOSE OF TRANSFER:
        This transfer was created as part of the SDTS Mass Conversion
        of 1997, when large amounts of the USGS digital archive were
        converted to SDTS/RP. This transfer was produced from the 7.5 min
        Digital Elevation Model (i.e. DEM).

STANDARD AUTHORITY:  
        FIPS 173: The Spatial Data Transfer Standard 
        Part 5: Raster Profile With BIIF Extension, Draft Version July 1997

ISO 8211 CONFORMANCE:
        All files with extension *.DDF are in the ISO 8211 file transfer
        format. All SDTS spatial addresses are expressed in two 32 bit 
        binary sub-fields defined by the ISO8211.  Files are Level 2 of
        ISO 8211.
 
CATALOG DIRECTORY MODULE xxxxCATD.DDF:
        Each transfer will contain this catalog directory module which
        contains a listing of every SDTS ISO 8211 file included in the
        transfer.  (xxxx indicates a four-character transfer base which 
        is common to all files in a transfer.)

IDENTIFICATION MODULE xxxxIDEN.DDF:
        This module contains information that describes the overall
        characteristics of the data in a transfer.
