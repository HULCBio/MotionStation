Two adjacent georeferenced grayscale (panchromatic) orthoimages covering
part of Concord, Massachusetts, USA comprising the following files:
 
   concord_ortho_e.tif
   concord_ortho_e.tfw
   
   concord_ortho_w.tif
   concord_ortho_w.tfw

Each orthoimage consists of a TIFF (.tif) and TIFF worldfile (.tfw) pair.
Each TIFF contains a 2000-by-2000 8-bit indexed-color image in which each
pixel corresponds to a 1-by-1 meter square in map coordinates.
The worldfiles contain georeferencing parameters.
