The objective of edge matching is to improve the alignment of ridges and drains, and overall topographic shaping and representation. Code of 0 = not edge matched; 1 = edge match checked and joined; 2 = not edge matched because adjoining DEM is on a different horizontal or vertical datum; 3 = not edge matched because the adjoining DEM is not part of the current project; 4 = not edge matched because the adjoining DEM has a different vertical unit.00612 D     00045   33 40001002000DQLC5650021DQLC2NULL SCHEME: The method for indicating no value for a cell in the Cell module records contained in this transfer is described here. In the Data Dictionary Domain module there are specific values that are reserved to mean VOID FILL for ELEVATION. VOID means there is no elevation measurement available for a cell that falls within the *geographic boundaries* of the DEM. (In the geographic coordinate system the bounds of the DEM data are rectangular.) A Fill also means there is no data, but is used to make the DEM rectangular in the UTM coordinate system.
