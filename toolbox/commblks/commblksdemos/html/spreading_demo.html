      <h1>Spreading Sequences</h1>
      <p>A spread-spectrum communication system is one in which the transmitted signal is spread over a wide frequency band, typically
         much wider than the minimum bandwidth required to transmit the data.  The spreading uses a waveform that appears random to
         anyone except the intended receiver of the transmitted signal.  The waveform is actually pseudo-random in the sense that it
         can be generated by precise rules yet has the statistical properties of a truly random sequence.
      </p>
      <p>Spreading consists of multiplying the input data by a pseudo-random or pseudo-noise (PN) sequence, the bit rate of which is
         much higher than the data bit rate.  This increases the data rate while adding redundancy to the system.  The ratio of the
         sequence bit rate to the data rate is known as the spreading factor.  When the signal is received, the spreading is removed
         from the desired signal by multiplying it by the same PN sequence that is exactly synchronized to the transmitted PN signal.
          When such a despreading operation is applied to the interferer's signals, ideally there is no further contribution to the
         user of interest's signal level. This is achieved in CDMA systems by assigning each user/transmitter distinct codes that have
         low cross-correlation properties, such as the ideal orthogonal codes or any one of the PN, Gold or Kasami sequences.

      <p>The model uses random binary data which is BPSK modulated (real), spread by orthogonal codes of length 64 and then transmitted
         over a AWGN channel. The receiver consists of a despreader followed by a BPSK demodulator.

          To take advantage of the multipath transmission, the receiver employs diversity reception which combines the independent
         paths coherently.
