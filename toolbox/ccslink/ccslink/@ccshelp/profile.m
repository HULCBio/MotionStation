function ps = profile(cc,fmt,timeout)
%PROFILE  Returns code execution profile information.
%  PS = PROFILE(CC,OPT,TIMEOUT) returns code profile measurements from any
%  defined statistics timing objects (STS) in the processor referenced by
%  the CC object.  STS objects are a service of the DSP/BIOS(tm) real-time
%  kernel and can be used  for code profiling and tracking.  The OPT
%  parameter defines the  format of the returned data.  TIMEOUT defines an
%  upper limit (in seconds) on the time this method will wait for
%  completion.  If the specified timeout period is exceeded,  this method
%  will immediately return with a timeout error.  
%
%  OPT options:
%
%  'report' - Generate an HTML report summarizing STS object statistics
%     and return the filename.  
%
%     For DSP/BIOS applications generated by the Embedded Target
%     for Texas Instruments TMS320C6000(tm) DSP Platform, this
%     HTML report can also show subsystem-based profiling details. 
%
%  'tic' - Return a formatted list of timing objects.  The 'tic' 
%     structure contains the following fields:
%     PS.cpuload   - Execution time spent out of the idle task (percent)
%     PS.sts       - Vector of defined STS objects
%     PS.sts(n).name  - User defined name given to the STS object
%     PS.sts(n).avg   - Average measured profile period (in seconds)
%     PS.sts(n).max   - Maximum measured profile period (in seconds)
%     PS.sts(n).count - Count of STS measurements that were taken
%     PS.sts(n).units - 'Hi Time' or 'Low Time' - String description 
%                       of the timer applied by this STS object
%
%  'raw' - Return a raw undocumented list of STS information.  Refer to
%    Code Composer documentation for details of this format.
%
%  PS = PROFILE(CC,TIMEOUT) returns the profile in 'tic' format.
%  PS = PROFILE  Same as above, except the default timeout
%  from the CC object is applied.
%
%  Note - For the reported time periods to be accurate, the CLK and 
%  STS objects in the DSP/BIOS project must be properly configured
%  for the embedded target.
