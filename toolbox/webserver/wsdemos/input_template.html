<!--
Modify this file to create your own HTML input form and save
as <MY_INPUT>.html where <MY_INPUT> is replaced by a name that
has meaning within the context of your application.  (Remember
that many web servers expect case-sensitive file naming.)
-->


<!-- STEP 1
Choose either the NT version or the Unix version 
of the form tag (depending on which platform the
matweb client program will be run):
-->

<!-- NT version: -->
<form action="/cgi-bin/matweb.exe" method="POST">
<!-- Unix version: -->
<form action="/cgi-bin/matweb" method="POST">



<!-- STEP 2
Create a hidden field naming your M-file.  Replace
MY_M_FILE with the name of main MATLAB function of 
your application. (An HTML input field of type "hidden"
is commonly  used to pass variables to a web server.
It is not displayed by the browser.)
-->
<input type="hidden" name="mlmfile" value="my_m_file">



<!-- STEP 3
Add all your other HTML form tags here.  Replace 
MY_INPUT_VARIABLE_1 with the name of an input variable in
your application.
-->
<p>My input variable 1: <input type="text" name="my_input_variable_1">


<!--
Create additional input variables here.
-->



<!-- STEP 4
Create a "submit" input tag for the user to click to send
the input to your program.
-->

<p><input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Submit"></p>

</form>



<!-- STEP 5
Add the name of your main application function to 
the file matweb.conf.  See the matweb.conf file in
the wsdemos directory and the documentation.)
