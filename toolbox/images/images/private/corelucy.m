%CORELUCY Accelerated Damped Lucy-Richarson Operator.
%  Calculates function that when used with the scaled projected array 
%  produces the next iteration array that maximizes the likelihood that 
%  the entire suite satisfies the Poisson statistics.

  %dimensions, with one of them consisting of elements of a single bin.

  %2. Bin (==calculate mean) along the first of the-to-binned dimension,
  %that dimension consists of the bin elements. Reshape to get rid off
