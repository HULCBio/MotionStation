%% Read Image
% Read in the 'snowflakes.png' image, which is a photograph of snowflakes.

I = imread('snowflakes.png');

%% Enhance Contrast
% Your first step is to maximize the intensity contrast in the image.  You can
% do this using ADAPTHISTEQ, which performs contrast-limited adaptive histogram
% equalization. Rescale the image intensity using IMADJUST so that it
% fills the data type's entire dynamic range.

%% Determine Intensity Surface Area Distribution in Enhanced Image
% Granulometry estimates the intensity surface area distribution of
% snowflakes as a function of size. Granulometry likens image objects to stones
% whose sizes can be determined by sifting them through screens of increasing
% size and collecting what remains after each pass. Image objects are sifted by
% opening the image with a structuring element of increasing size and counting
% the remaining intensity surface area (summation of pixel values in the image)
% after each opening. 
%
% Choose a counter limit so that the intensity surface area goes to zero as
% you increase the size of your structuring element.
% For display purposes, leave the first entry in the surface area array empty.

%% Calculate First Derivative of Distribution
% A significant drop in intensity surface area between two consecutive openings
% indicates that the image contains objects of comparable size to the smaller
% opening. This is equivalent to the first derivative of the intensity surface
% area array, which contains the size distribution of the snowflakes in the
% image. Calculate the first derivative with the DIFF function.

%% Extract snowflakes having a particular radius
% Notice the minima and the radii where they occur in the graph.  The minima
% tell you that snowflakes in the image have those radii. The more negative the
% minimum point, the higher the snowflakes' cumulative intensity at that radius.
% For example, the most negative minimum point occurs at the 5 pixel radius
% mark. You can extract the snowflakes having a 5 pixel radius with the
% following steps.
