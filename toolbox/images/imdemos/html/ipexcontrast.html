      <p>Using the default settings, compare the effectiveness of the following three techniques:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><b><tt>imadjust</tt></b> increases the contrast of the image by mapping the values              of the input intensity image to new values such that,
                         by default, 1% of the data is saturated at low and high              intensities of the input data.
         </li>
         <li><b><tt>histeq</tt></b> performs histogram equalization. It enhances the contrast            of images by transforming the values in an intensity
            image            so that the histogram of the output image            approximately matches a specified histogram (uniform
            distribution            by default).
         </li>
         <li><b><tt>adapthisteq</tt></b> performs contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization.            Unlike <tt>histeq</tt>, it operates on small data regions (tiles)            rather than the entire image. Each tile's contrast is            enhanced
            so that the histogram of each output region approximately            matches the specified histogram (uniform distribution
            by default).            The contrast enhancement can be limited in order to avoid            amplifying the noise which might
            be present in the image.
