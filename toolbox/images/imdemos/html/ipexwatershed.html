      <h1>Marker-Controlled Watershed Segmentation</h1>
      <p>Separating touching objects in an image is one of the more difficult image processing operations.  The watershed transform
         is often applied to this problem.  The watershed transform finds "catchment basins" and "watershed ridge lines" in an image
         by treating it as a surface where light pixels are high and dark pixels are low.
      </p>
      <p>Segmentation using the watershed transform works better if you can identify, or "mark," foreground objects and background
         locations. Marker-controlled watershed segmentation follows this basic procedure:
      </p>
      <p>1. Compute a segmentation function.  This is an image whose dark regions are the objects you are trying to segment.</p>
      <p>2. Compute foreground markers.  These are connected blobs of pixels within each of the objects.</p>
      <p>3. Compute background markers.  These are pixels that are not part of any object.</p>
      <p>4. Modify the segmentation function so that it only has minima at the foreground and background marker locations.</p>
      <p>5. Compute the watershed transform of the modified segmentation function.</p>

se = strel('disk', 20);
Io = imopen(I, se);
figure, imshow(Io), title('Io')

%%
% Next compute the opening-by-reconstruction using |imerode| and
% |imreconstruct|.

Ie = imerode(I, se);
Iobr = imreconstruct(Ie, I);
figure, imshow(Iobr), title('Iobr')

%%
% Following the opening with a closing can remove the dark spots
% and stem marks.  Compare a regular morphological closing with a
% closing-by-reconstruction.  First try |imclose|:

Ioc = imclose(Io, se);
figure, imshow(Ioc), title('Ioc')

% Now use |imdilate| followed by |imreconstruct|.  Notice you must 
% complement the image inputs and output of |imreconstruct|.

D = bwdist(bw);
DL = watershed(D);

gradmag2 = imimposemin(gradmag, bgm | fgm4);

%%
% Finally we are ready to compute the watershed-based segmentation.

L = watershed(gradmag2);

%% Step 6: Visualize the result
% One visualization technique is to superimpose the foreground
