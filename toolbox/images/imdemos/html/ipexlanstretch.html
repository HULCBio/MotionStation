      <h2>Step 1: Construct truecolor composite from a multispectral image<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>The LAN file, <tt>paris.lan</tt>, contains a 7-band 512-by-512 Landsat image. A 128-byte header is followed by the pixel values, which are band interleaved
         by line (BIL) in order of increasing band number.  They are stored as unsigned 8-bit integers, in little-endian byte order.

%% Enhancing Multispectral Color Composite Images
% It is often necessary to enhance multispectral radiance or reflectance 
% data to create an image that is suitable for visual interpretation.
%
% This example illustrates some basic image composition and enhancement
% techniques for use with multispectral data.  It uses Landsat thematic
% mapper imagery covering part of Paris, France.  Seven spectral bands are
% stored in one file in the Erdas LAN format. Concepts covered include:
% 
% * Reading multispectral data from Erdas LAN files
% * Constructing color composites from different band combinations
% * Enhancing imagery with a contrast stretch
% * Enhancing imagery with a decorrelation stretch
% * Using scatterplots
