      <h1>FIR Nyquist (L-th band) Filter Design</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>This demo illustrates the design capabilities of the FIRNYQUIST function. It also compares the filters designed with FIRNYQUIST
            to those designed with FIRRCOS.
         </p>
         <p>Both produce lowpass Nyquist filters, widely used in pulse-shaping for digital transmission systems.  These filters also find
            application in interpolation/decimation and filter banks.

      <h2>Magnitude Response Comparison<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>The plot shows the magnitude response of filters designed with each function. Both filters have an order of 60 and a rolloff-factor
         of 0.5. Because the FIRNYQUIST filter has an optimal equiripple response, it has a larger stopband attenuation for the same
         filter order and transition width.  The raised-cosine filter designed with FIRRCOS is obtained by truncating the analytical
         impulse response and it is not optimal in any sense.

      </p>
      <h2>Impulse Response Comparison<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>Here we compare the impulse responses.  Notice that the impulse response in both cases is zero every 4th sample (except for
         the middle sample). Nyquist filters are also known as L-th band filters, because the cutoff frequency is Pi/L and the impulse
         response is zero every L-th sample.  In this case we have 4th band filters.

      <p>FIRNYQUIST allows for control of the slope of the stopband of the filter. For example, the following designs have slopes of
         0, 20, and 40 dB/(rad/sample)of attenuation:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">b1 = firnyquist(52,8,.2,0); <span class="comment">% Equiripple</span>

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="firnyquistdemo_03.png"> <h2>Minimum-Phase Design<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <p>FIRNYQUIST can return a minimum-phase spectral factor of the overall Nyquist filter (a square-root in the frequency domain).
          This spectral factor can be used in a similar manner to the square-root raised-cosine filter in matched filtering applications.
          A square-root of the filter is placed on the transmiter's end and the other square root is placed at the receiver's end.

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="firnyquistdemo_04.png"> <h2>Decreasing the Rolloff Factor<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>The response of the raised-cosine filter improves as the rolloff factor decreases (shown here for rolloff = 0.2).  This is
         because of the narrow main lobe of the frequency response of a rectangular window that is used in the truncation of the impulse
         response.

      <p>FIRNYQUIST can also design Nyquist filters using the truncated-and-windowed impulse response method. This can be another alternative

%% Magnitude Response Comparison
% The plot shows the magnitude response of filters designed with each
% function. Both filters have an order of 60 and a rolloff-factor of 0.5.
% Because the FIRNYQUIST filter has an optimal equiripple response, it has
% a larger stopband attenuation for the same filter order and transition
% width.  The raised-cosine filter designed with FIRRCOS is obtained by
% truncating the analytical impulse response and it is not optimal in any
% sense.

% attenuation.

%% Impulse Response Comparison
% Here we compare the impulse responses.  Notice that the impulse response
% in both cases is zero every 4th sample (except for the middle sample).
% Nyquist filters are also known as L-th band filters, because the cutoff
% frequency is Pi/L and the impulse response is zero every L-th sample.  In

%% Nyquist Filters with a Sloped Stopband
% FIRNYQUIST allows for control of the slope of the stopband of the filter.
% For example, the following designs have slopes of 0, 20, and 40
% dB/(rad/sample)of attenuation:

b1 = firnyquist(52,8,.2,0); % Equiripple
b2 = firnyquist(52,8,.2,20);

%% Minimum-Phase Design
% FIRNYQUIST can return a minimum-phase spectral factor of the overall
% Nyquist filter (a square-root in the frequency domain).  This spectral
% factor can be used in a similar manner to the square-root raised-cosine
% filter in matched filtering applications.  A square-root of the filter is

legend(hfvt,'FIRNYQUIST minimum-phase design',...
    'Square-root raised-cosine design');

%% Decreasing the Rolloff Factor
% The response of the raised-cosine filter improves as the rolloff factor
% decreases (shown here for rolloff = 0.2).  This is because of the narrow
% main lobe of the frequency response of a rectangular window that is used
% in the truncation of the impulse response.

%% Windowed-Impulse-Response Nyquist Design
% FIRNYQUIST can also design Nyquist filters using the
% truncated-and-windowed impulse response method. This can be another
% alternative to the raised-cosine design.
%
% For example, using the Kaiser window, we can design a filter that meets
% the following specs:

bwin = firnyquist('minorder',4,0.5,1.25e-6);

%%
% This designs only requires a slight increase in order (62 vs. 60) to meet

% required an extraordinary 1400th-order raised-cosine filter to meet the
% stopband spec.)

%% Nyquist Criterion
% An important characteristic of Nyquist filters is that along with its
% shifted versions by a factor of k/L, L being the band and k = 1,2,...,L-1
% should all add up to a delay, i.e. they form a set of strictly

% transmission).

    H(k+1) = dfilt.dffir(h.*exp(2*pi*j*k*nb/4));
    Bw(k+1)= dfilt.dffir(bwin.*exp(2*pi*j*k*nbw/4));

%% Nyquist Filters for Interpolation
% Besides digital data transmission, Nyquist filters are attractive for

%%
% The polyphase subfilter #4 is an allpass filter, in fact it is a pure
% delay (select impulse response in FVTool, or look at the filter
% coefficients in FVTool), so that:
% 1. All of its multipliers are zero except for one, leading to an
