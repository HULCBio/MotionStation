      <h1>Adaptive Line Enhancer (ALE)</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>This demonstration illustrates the application of adaptive filters to signal separation using a structure called an adaptive
            line enhancer (ALE).  In adaptive line enhancement, a measured signal x(n) contains two signals, an unknown signal of interest
            v(n), and a nearly-periodic noise signal eta(n).
         </p>
         <p>The goal is to remove the noise signal from the measured signal to obtain the signal of interest.</p>

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="aledemo_03.png"> <h2>Adaptive Filter Configuration<a name="8"></a></h2>
      <p>An adaptive line enhancer (ALE) is based on the straightforward concept of linear prediction.  A nearly-periodic signal can
         be perfectly predicted using linear combinations of its past samples, whereas a non-periodic signal cannot.  So, a delayed
         version of the measured signal s(n-D) is used as the reference input signal x(n) to the adaptive filter, and the desired response
         signal d(n) is made equal to s(n). The parameters to choose in such a system are the signal delay D and the filter length
         L used in the adaptive linear estimate.  The amount of delay depends on the amount of correlation in the signal of interest.
         Since we don't have this signal (if we did, we wouldn't need the ALE!), we shall just pick a value of D=100 and vary it later.
          Such a choice suggests that samples of the Hallelujah Chorus are uncorrelated if they are more than about 12 msec apart.
          Also, we'll choose a value of L=32 for the adaptive filter, although this too could be changed.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">D = 100;
L  = 32;
</pre><p>Finally, we shall be using some block adaptive algorithms that require the lengths of the vectors for x(n) and d(n) to be
         integer multiples of the block length.  We'll choose a block length of N=32 with which to begin.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">N = 32;
ntr = N*floor((length(v)-D)/N);
x = s(1:ntr);
d = s(1+D:ntr+D);
</pre><h2>Block LMS<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>The first algorithm we shall explore is the Block LMS algorithm.  This algorithm is similar to the well-known least-mean-square
         (LMS) algorithm, except that it employs block coefficient updates instead of sample-by-sample coefficient updates.  It also
         runs efficiently in MATLAB when the block lengths are more than a few samples. The Block LMS algorithm needs an initial coefficient
         vector W0, a block length N, and a step size value mu.  We'll set W0 to be an all-zero vector of length L, and N is already
         defined.  How do we pick mu?  Let's start with a value of mu = 0.0001 and refine it shortly.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">mu = 0.0001;
leak = 1; <span class="comment">% No leakage</span>
h = adaptfilt.blms(L,mu,leak,N);
</pre><h2>Refining the Step Size<a name="11"></a></h2>
      <p>The Filter Design Toolbox has some built-in analysis functionality for some of its adaptive filters.  These analysis files
         can, among other things, compute upper step size bounds as suggested by statistical analyses of the adaptive algorithm.  We
         can "run" these analyses by calling them just like their adaptive algorithm counterparts. Running the Block LMS analysis function,
         we get the following mean and mean-square step size bounds:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">[mumax,mumaxmse] = maxstep(h,x)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
mumax =

    0.4636


mumaxmse =

    0.1545

</pre><p>So, our chosen step size of mu=0.0001 is well within the stability regions of both mean and mean-square analyses.  Let's run
         the algorithm...
      </p>
      <h2>Running the Filter<a name="13"></a></h2>
      <p>The output signal y(n) should largely contain the periodic sinusoid, whereas the error signal e(n) should contain the musical
         information, if we've done everything right.  Since we have the original music signal v(n), we can plot e(n) vs. v(n) on the
         same plot shown above along with the residual signal e(n)-v(n).  It looks like the system is converged after about 5 seconds
         of adaptation with this step size.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">[y,e] = filter(h,x,d);
plot(1/Fs:1/Fs:ntr/Fs,v(1+D:ntr+D),1/Fs:1/Fs:ntr/Fs,e,1/Fs:1/Fs:ntr/Fs,e-v(1+D:ntr+D));

legend(<span class="string">'Noiseless Music Signal v(n)'</span>,<span class="string">'Error Signal e(n)'</span>,<span class="string">'Difference e(n)-v(n)'</span>);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="aledemo_04.png"> <h2>Listening to the Error Signal<a name="14"></a></h2>
      <p>The real proof, however, is in the listening; The following code allows you to hear the error signal e(n)...</p><pre class="codeinput">sound(e,Fs);
</pre><p>Notice how the sinusoidal noise decays away slowly. This behavior is due to the adaptation of the filter coefficients toward
         their optimum values.
      </p>
      <h2>Listening to the Residual Signal<a name="16"></a></h2>
      <p>We can listen to the residual signal e(n)-v(n) as well to hear what is left over in the error signal.</p><pre class="codeinput">sound(e-v(1+D:ntr+D),Fs);
</pre><p>Notice how this residual signal sounds like a hollow and quieter version of the original music once the adaptive filter has
         converged.  That is why we don't hear it; it simply changes the frequency content of the music a little bit.  Remember, a
         linear filter cannot totally separate signals that are overlapped in frequency, so we can expect some errors in the output.
         We won't listen to the adaptive filter output y(n); it sounds like a 1000 Hz tone subtracted from this same small residual
         signal.
      </p>
      <h2>FM Noise Source<a name="18"></a></h2>
      <p>Now, removing a pure sinusoid from a sinusoid plus music signal is not particularly challenging if the frequency of the offending
         sinusoid is known.  A simple two-pole, two-zero notch filter can perform this task. So, let's make the problem a bit harder
         by adding an FM-modulated sinusoidal signal as our noise source.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">eta = 0.5*sin(2*pi*1000/Fs*(1:length(s))+10*sin(2*pi/Fs*(1:length(s))));
