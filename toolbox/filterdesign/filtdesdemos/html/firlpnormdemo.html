      <h1>Least Pth-norm Optimal FIR Filter Design</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>This demo shows some of the key features of the FIRLPNORM function.  This function uses a least-Pth unconstrained optimization
            algorithm to design FIR filters with arbitrary magnitude response.
         </p>

      <h2>FIRLPNORM syntax<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>The syntax for FIRLPNORM is similar to that of IIRLPNORM (see the least Pth-norm optimal IIR filter design demo for details)
         except that (obviously) the denominator order is not specified.
      </p>
      <p>The function designs optimal FIR filters in the least-Pth sense. However the filter is not constrained to have linear-phase
         (although linear-phase is generally considered a good thing) i.e. the impulse response has no special symmetry properties.
      </p>
      <p>However, the linear-phase constraint also results in filters with larger order than the more general nonlinear-phase designs
         (we should point out that in some hardware implementations, one can reduce the number of multipliers in half when implementing
         linear-phase filters because of the symmetry in the coefficients). For example, consider the following FIRLPNORM design
      </p><pre class="codeinput">N = 30;
F = [0 0.3 0.45 1];
E = F;
A = [1 1 0 0];
W = [1 1 10 10];
b = firlpnorm(30,F,E,A,W);
hlpnorm = dfilt.dffir(b);
h = fvtool(hlpnorm);
set(h,<span class="string">'MagnitudeDisplay'</span>,<span class="string">'Magnitude'</span>);
set(h, <span class="string">'Color'</span>, [1 1 1])
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="firlpnormdemo_01.png"> <p>If we zoom in, we can see that the filter has a passband peak ripple of about 0.008 and stopband peak ripple of about 0.000832.
         A FIRPM or FIRGR design with comparable specs will require a 37th order filter. This is especially significant considering
         that FIRGR will provide the lowest order linear-phase FIR filter that meets the specifications.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">dev = [0.008 0.000832];
b=firgr(<span class="string">'minorder'</span>,F,A,dev);
hfirgr = dfilt.dffir(b);
orderfirgr = order(hfirgr)
addfilter(h,hfirgr)
legend(h,<span class="string">'FIRLPNORM design'</span>,<span class="string">'FIRGR design'</span>);
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
orderfirgr =

    37

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="firlpnormdemo_02.png"> <p>Another way to look at this is by using the FIRCEQRIP function which also designs linear-phase equiripple filters, but whose
         specifications are given in a different way to FIRGR (see the constrained equiripple FIR filter design demo for details).
         If we want a linear-phase filter of 30th order that meets the passband and stopband ripple that the design from FIRLPNORM
         achieves we need to live with a larger transition width.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">b = firceqrip(30,(F(2)+F(3))/2,dev);

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="firlpnormdemo_03.png"> <h2>Minimum-Phase Designs<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>Of course it is also possible to design nonlinear-phase filters with FIRGR by specifying the 'minphase' option. Doing so,
         allows us to obtain an FIR filter of lower order than in the linear-phase case and still meet the required specs. However,
         even in this case, the  result is a non-optimal nonlinear-phase filter because the filter order is larger than the minimum
         required for a nonlinear-phase equiripple filter to meet the specs as is evident from the following example.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">b = firgr(<span class="string">'minorder'</span>,F,A,dev,<span class="string">'minphase'</span>);

      <p>FIRLPNORM does allow for the option to constrain the zeros to lie on or inside the unit circle, resulting in a minimum-phase
         design. The constraint, however, results in larger passband ripple and less stopband attenuation than the unconstrained design.

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="firlpnormdemo_06.png"> <h2>Changing the Pth-Norm<a name="7"></a></h2>
      <p>Like IIRLPNORM and IIRLPNORMC, FIRLPNORM allows for the specification of the Pth-norm used to optimize the filter. The Pth-norm
         is specified in the exact same way as in IIRLPNORM, i.e. a two element vector with Pinit and Pfinal as its elements. Pinit
         specifies the initial Pth-norm used by the algorithm (this aids in the convergence) and Pfinal specifies the final Pth-norm
         with which the filter is optimized.
      </p>
      <p>For example, a least-squares design for the above specs can be obtained as follows:</p><pre class="codeinput">N = 40;

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="firlpnormdemo_07.png"> <h2>Comparing to FIRLS<a name="8"></a></h2>
      <p>In comparison, we design a linear-phase least-squares filter using FIRLS. Once again, for the same filter order, the linear-phase
         constraint results in less stopband attenuation and a larger passband ripple.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">W = [1 20];
b = firls(N,F,A,W);
hls = dfilt.dffir(b);
set(h, <span class="string">'Filters'</span>, [hl2,hls]);
legend(h,<span class="string">'FIRLPNORM design'</span>,<span class="string">'FIRLS design'</span>);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="firlpnormdemo_08.png"> <h2>Other Norms<a name="9"></a></h2>
      <p>Equiripple designs are useful when one requires the smallest possible order to meet a set of design specifications. To meet
         the same specs with a least-squares design requires a higher order filter. However, the higher order does provide extra attenuation
         (less ripple) for a large portion of the stopband (passband). In fact least-squares design minimize the energy of the stopband.
         Compromises between equiripple design and least-squares design can be reached by using intermediate norms. For example we
         show the design of a filter wih the same specs, but optimized for the following norms: 2, 4, 12, 256 (approx. infinity norm).

set(h, 'Color', [1 1 1])

% If we zoom in, we can see that the filter has a passband peak ripple of

%% Minimum-Phase Designs
% Of course it is also possible to design nonlinear-phase filters with
% FIRGR by specifying the 'minphase' option. Doing so, allows us to obtain
% an FIR filter of lower order than in the linear-phase case and still meet

%% Minimum-Phase Designs with FIRLPNORM
% FIRLPNORM does allow for the option to constrain the zeros to lie on or

% If we increase the order to that of the minimum-phase filter designed

set(h, 'Filters', [hlpnorm,hfirgrmin,hlpnormmin2]);
legend(h,'FIRLPNORM design',...
    'FIRGR minimum-phase design',...
    'FIRLPNORM minimum-phase design');

%% Changing the Pth-Norm
% Like IIRLPNORM and IIRLPNORMC, FIRLPNORM allows for the specification of
% the Pth-norm used to optimize the filter. The Pth-norm is specified in
% the exact same way as in IIRLPNORM, i.e. a two element vector with Pinit
% and Pfinal as its elements. Pinit specifies the initial Pth-norm used by
% the algorithm (this aids in the convergence) and Pfinal specifies the
% final Pth-norm with which the filter is optimized.
%
% For example, a least-squares design for the above specs can be obtained
% as follows:

N = 40;
F = [0 0.4 0.45 1];
E = F;
A = [0 0 1 1];
W = [1 1 10 10];
P = [2 2];
b = firlpnorm(N,F,E,A,W,P);
hl2 = dfilt.dffir(b);
set(h, 'Filters', hl2);
legend(h,'FIRLPNORM design')

%% Comparing to FIRLS
% In comparison, we design a linear-phase least-squares filter using FIRLS.
% Once again, for the same filter order, the linear-phase constraint
% results in less stopband attenuation and a larger passband ripple.

W = [1 20];
b = firls(N,F,A,W);
hls = dfilt.dffir(b);
set(h, 'Filters', [hl2,hls]);
legend(h,'FIRLPNORM design','FIRLS design');

%% Other Norms
% Equiripple designs are useful when one requires the smallest possible
% order to meet a set of design specifications. To meet the same specs with
% a least-squares design requires a higher order filter. However, the
% higher order does provide extra attenuation (less ripple) for a large
% portion of the stopband (passband). In fact least-squares design minimize
% the energy of the stopband. Compromises between equiripple design and
% least-squares design can be reached by using intermediate norms. For
% example we show the design of a filter wih the same specs, but optimized
% for the following norms: 2, 4, 12, 256 (approx. infinity norm).

W = [1 1 10 10];
P4 = [2 4];
b = firlpnorm(N,F,E,A,W,P4);
hl4 = dfilt.dffir(b);
P12 = [2 12];
b = firlpnorm(N,F,E,A,W,P12);
hl12 = dfilt.dffir(b);
Pinf = [2 256];
b = firlpnorm(N,F,E,A,W,Pinf);
hlinf = dfilt.dffir(b);
set(h, 'Filters', [hl2,hl4,hl12,hlinf]);
legend(h,'P = 2','P = 4','P = 12','P = 256');

%%
% In order to meet the minimum stopband attenuation of the equiripple
% (256-norm) case it is necessary to increase the order of the other
% designs.
