      <h1>Efficient Narrow Transition-Band FIR Filter Design</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>One of the drawbacks of using FIR filters is that the filter order tends to grow inversely proportional to the transition
            bandwidth of the filter. This demo showcases efficient designs of FIR filters with very narrow transition-bands using the
            interpolated FIR (IFIR) function.

      <h2>Interpolated FIR (IFIR) Design<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>From multirate signal processing theory, it is well-known that upsampling a signal compresses its spectrum. This fact is used
         in IFIR design. Instead of directly designing a filter that meets the transition band requirements, we design a filter that
         meets L*Fpass and L*Fstop as its band-edges, where L is the interpolation factor (that is, we stretch the transition width
         by a factor of L). Because the filter order grows inversely proportional to the transition width, the filter order required
         to meet the "stretched-out" specs is significantly lower than the filter order required to meet the original specs.
      </p>
      <p>For example, suppose L = 4.</p><pre class="codeinput">L = 4; <span class="comment">% Interpolation factor</span>
F = [0 Fpass*L Fstop*L 1];
bstrech = firgr(<span class="string">'minorder'</span>,F,A,R);

      <h2>Upsampling the Filter<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>We have reduced the filter length significantly. Of course, that is not the filter that we wanted. If we now upsample the
         impulse response by a factor of L, the spectrum is compressed by such a factor and we meet the original transition band requirements:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">bup = upsample(bstrech,L);

    <span class="string">'Analysis'</span>, <span class="string">'magnitude'</span>);

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="ifirdemo_03.png"> <p>The upsampled "stretched" design has a total length of 696 which is slightly larger than the original design (694). So the
         overall delay in the filter is slightly larger. However, there are only 174 nonzero multipliers. Unfortunately, we don't yet
         have the lowpass filter we need. The upsampling has introduced unwanted spectral replicas. The idea of IFIR design is to cascade
         the upsampled filter with a low order lowpass filter that removes this spectral replicas.

%% Design of a Filter with Narrow Transition Bandwidth
% Consider the following design specifications:

Rpass = 0.001;  % Passband ripple
Fpass = 0.13;   % Passband edge
Rstop = 0.0005; % Stopband ripple
Fstop = 0.14;   % Stopband edge

%%
% A regular linear-phase equiripple design that meets the specs can be
% designed with:

F= [0 Fpass Fstop 1];
A = [1 1 0 0];
R = [Rpass Rstop];
b = firgr('minorder',F,A,R);
hfvt = fvtool(b,'Analysis','info');
set(hfvt, 'Color', [1 1 1]);

%%
% The filter length required turns out to be 694 taps.

%% Interpolated FIR (IFIR) Design
% From multirate signal processing theory, it is well-known that upsampling
% a signal compresses its spectrum. This fact is used in IFIR design.
% Instead of directly designing a filter that meets the transition band
% requirements, we design a filter that meets L*Fpass and L*Fstop as its
% band-edges, where L is the interpolation factor (that is, we stretch the
% transition width by a factor of L). Because the filter order grows
% inversely proportional to the transition width, the filter order required
% to meet the "stretched-out" specs is significantly lower than the filter
% order required to meet the original specs.
%
% For example, suppose L = 4. 

L = 4; % Interpolation factor
F = [0 Fpass*L Fstop*L 1];
bstrech = firgr('minorder',F,A,R);
set(hfvt, 'Filters', dfilt.dffir(bstrech));

%%
% The filter length required reduces to 174 taps

%% Upsampling the Filter
% We have reduced the filter length significantly. Of course, that is not
% the filter that we wanted. If we now upsample the impulse response by a
% factor of L, the spectrum is compressed by such a factor and we meet the
% original transition band requirements:

bup = upsample(bstrech,L);
set(hfvt, 'Filters', [dfilt.dffir(b), dfilt.dffir(bup)], ...
    'Analysis', 'magnitude');
legend(hfvt,'Original design','Stretched and upsampled design');

%%
% The upsampled "stretched" design has a total length of 696 which is
% slightly larger than the original design (694). So the overall delay in
% the filter is slightly larger. However, there are only 174 nonzero
% multipliers. Unfortunately, we don't yet have the lowpass filter we need.
% The upsampling has introduced unwanted spectral replicas. The idea of
% IFIR design is to cascade the upsampled filter with a low order lowpass
% filter that removes this spectral replicas.

%% Removing the Spectral Replica
% Rather than continuing the design "by hand", we will now use the IFIR
% function. IFIR returns the two filters (the upsampled filter and the
% replica suppressor filter).
%
% We can choose different levels of optimization in the design:

[h,g]=ifir(L,'low',[Fpass Fstop],R,'simple');
set(hfvt, 'Filters', [dfilt.dffir(h),dfilt.dffir(g)]);
legend(hfvt,'Simple design, upsampled filter','Simple design, replica suppressor');

%%
[h2,g2]=ifir(L,'low',[Fpass Fstop],R,'intermediate');
set(hfvt, 'Filters', [dfilt.dffir(h2),dfilt.dffir(g2)]);
legend(hfvt,'Intermediate design, upsampled filter',...
    'Intermediate design, replica suppressor');

%%
[h3,g3]=ifir(L,'low',[Fpass Fstop],R,'advanced');
set(hfvt, 'Filters', [dfilt.dffir(h3),dfilt.dffir(g3)]);
legend(hfvt,'Advanced design, upsampled filter',...
    'Advanced design, replica suppressor');

%%
% In the 'simple' case, the replica suppressor filter is a simple lowpass
% filter (this case is the most robust and also the fastest design). In the
% 'intermediate' case, the replica suppressor filter is designed with a
% don't-care region (where the periodic filter already provides the
% required attenuation). This results in a (slight) reduction of filter
% order in some cases. The 'advanced' design is much more involved. It
% jointly optimizes the periodic filter and the replica suppressor filter in
% order to achieve the required specs. The result is significant savings in
% the order of the replica suppressor filter and a slighter savings in the
% order of the periodic filter.

%% Overall Filter Response
% The overall filter response can be found by forming a cascade of the two
% filters for each case:

Hoverall = cascade(dfilt.dffir(h),dfilt.dffir(g));
Hoverall2 = cascade(dfilt.dffir(h2),dfilt.dffir(g2));
Hoverall3 = cascade(dfilt.dffir(h3),dfilt.dffir(g3));
set(hfvt, 'Filters', [Hoverall,Hoverall2,Hoverall3]);
legend(hfvt,'Simple design','Intermediate design',...
    'Advanced design');

%% Multirate Implementations
% Because the periodic filter has many zeros, it lends itself nicely to
% multirate implementation. Instead of implementing it as a function of
% z^L, it can be placed after a downsampler (by a factor of L) -by making
% use of the noble identities- as a function of z. The reduction of the
% sampling rate will make things more efficient anyway, since the bandwidth
% of the signal will be reduced significantly by this lowpass filter.
% Otherwise the Nyquist sampling criterion will be unnecessarily
