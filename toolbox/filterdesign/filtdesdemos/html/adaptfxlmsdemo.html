      <h1>Active Noise Control Using a Filtered-X LMS FIR adaptive filter.</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>This demonstration illustrates the application of adaptive filters to the attenuation of acoustic noise via active noise control.
            In active  noise control, one attempts to reduce the volume of an unwanted noise propagating through the air using an electro-acoustic
            system using measurement sensors such as microphones and output actuators such as loudspeakers.  The noise signal usually
            comes from some device, such  as a rotating machine, so that it is possible to measure the noise near its source. The goal
            of the active noise control system is to  produce an "anti-noise" that attenuates the unwanted noise in a  desired quiet region
            using an adaptive filter.  This problem differs from traditional adaptive noise cancellation in that        - The desired
            response signal cannot be directly measured;          only the attenuated signal is available.        - The active noise control
            system must take into account the          secondary loudspeaker-to-microphone error path in its          adaptation. For
            more implementation details on active noise control tasks, see S.M. Kuo and D.R. Morgan, "Active Noise Control Systems:  Algorithms
            and DSP Implementations",  Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1996.

      <h2>The Secondary Propagation Path<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>The secondary propagation path is the path the anti-noise takes from the output loudspeaker to the error microphone within
         the quiet zone. The following commands generate a loudspeaker-to-error microphone impulse response that is bandlimited to
         the range 160 - 2000 Hz and with a filter length of 0.1 seconds. For this active noise control task, we shall use a sampling
         frequency of 8000 Hz.

      <p>The first task in active noise control is to estimate the impulse response of the secondary propagation path.  This step is
         usually performed prior to noise control using a synthetic random signal played through the output loudspeaker while the unwanted
         noise is not present. The following commands generate 3.75 seconds of this random noise as well as the measured signal at
         the error microphone.

dS = filter(H,1,s) + 0.01*randn(1,ntrS);
</pre><h2>Designing the Secondary Propagation Path Estimate<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>Typically, the length of the secondary path filter estimate is not as long as the actual secondary path and need not be for
         adequate control in most cases.  We shall use a secondary path filter length of 250 taps, corresponding to an impulse response
         length of 31 msec. While any adaptive FIR filtering algorithm could be used for this purpose, the normalized LMS algorithm
         is often used due to its simplicity and robustness. Plots of the output and error signals show that the algorithm converges
         after about 10000 iterations.
