    Hm = MFILT.FIRINTERP(L,NUM) returns a direct-form FIR polyphase
    interpolator Hm.
  
    L is the interpolation factor. It must be an integer. If not specified,
    it defaults to 2.
 
    NUM is a vector containing the coefficients of the FIR lowpass filter
    used for interpolation. If omitted, a low-pass Nyquist filter of gain L
    and cutoff frequency of Pi/L is designed by default. 
 
    EXAMPLE: Interpolation by a factor of 2 (used to convert from 22.05kHz
    to 44.1kHz)
       L = 2;                               % Interpolation factor
       Hm = mfilt.firinterp(L);             % We use the default filter
       Fs = 22.05e3;                        % Original sampling frequency: 22.05kHz
       n = 0:5119;                          % 5120 samples, 0.232 second long signal

    P=POLYPHASE(Hm) returns the polyphase matrix of the multirate filter

</pre><h2>Creating Multirate Filters<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>To create a multirate filter (MFILT) object, you need to select the structure to be used. Most constructors take the coefficients
         of the filter as an optional last input argument. If the coefficients are not specified, a default filter is designed according
         to the interpolation and/or decimation factor(s).

</pre><h2>Getting and Setting the Filter Coefficients<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>To manipulate the coefficients of a filter as a regular MATLAB vector, you can always get them from the object. To modify
         the coefficients of an existing MFILT object, you can set new ones. Direct-form FIR structures only have numerator coefficients;
         these are also known as the filter weights.

      <p>The analysis of multirate filter (MFILT) objects is similar to that of discrete-time filter (DFILT) objects. In  particular,

      <p>By default, the states of the filter, stored in the 'States' property, are each initialized to zero. Furthermore the 'ResetBeforeFiltering'
         property is 'on' which means that the object is reset before the filter is run. This allows to filter the same sequence twice
         and produce the same output. For example:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">x = 1:6;
y1 = filter(h2,x) <span class="comment">% First run</span>
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">

    3.0133

</pre><p>Notice that after the second run, the states of the object are the same as after the first run. Because the 'ResetBeforeFiltering'
         property was 'on', the states were reinitialized to zeros before the second run.
      </p>
      <h2>Specifying Initial Conditions to the Filter<a name="15"></a></h2>
      <p>The user can specify initial conditions by turning the 'ResetBeforeFiltering' property 'off' and setting the 'States' property.
         If a scalar is specified, it will be expanded to the correct number of states. If a vector is specified, its length must be
         equal to the number of states. For example:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">h2.ResetBeforeFiltering=<span class="string">'off'</span>;
h2.States = zf1;
y3 = filter(h2,x) <span class="comment">% Run the filter with final states of first run</span>
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
y3 =

</pre><pre class="codeoutput">

    2.9580
    3.4904

</pre><p>As expected, both the output of the filter and the states are different than in the first run.</p>
      <h2>Streaming Data to the Filter<a name="18"></a></h2>
      <p>Setting the 'ResetBeforeFiltering' property 'off' is a convenient feature for streaming data to the filter. Breaking up a
         signal and filtering in a loop is equivalent to filtering the entire signal at once. We will emulate streaming data by using
         the filter in a loop:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">reset(h2); <span class="comment">% Clear history of the filter</span>
xsec = reshape(x(:),2,3);    <span class="comment">% Breaking the signal in 3 sections</span>

y = filter(h2,x)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">

%% Filtering with Multirate Filters
% By default, the states of the filter, stored in the 'States' property,
% are each initialized to zero. Furthermore the 'ResetBeforeFiltering'
% property is 'on' which means that the object is reset before the filter
% is run. This allows to filter the same sequence twice and produce the

% At this point, we verify that the object holds non-zero final conditions.
zf1 = h2.States 

%%
y2 = filter(h2,x) % Second run
%%
zf2 = h2.States
%%
% Notice that after the second run, the states of the object are the same
% as after the first run. Because the 'ResetBeforeFiltering' property was 'on', 
% the states were reinitialized to zeros before the second run.

%% Specifying Initial Conditions to the Filter
% The user can specify initial conditions by turning the
% 'ResetBeforeFiltering' property 'off' and setting the 'States' property.
% If a scalar is specified, it will be expanded to the correct number of
% states. If a vector is specified, its length must be equal to the number
% of states. For example:
h2.ResetBeforeFiltering='off';
h2.States = zf1;
y3 = filter(h2,x) % Run the filter with final states of first run
%%
zf3 = h2.States

%%
% As expected, both the output of the filter and the states are
% different than in the first run. 

%% Streaming Data to the Filter
% Setting the 'ResetBeforeFiltering' property 'off' is a convenient feature
% for streaming data to the filter. Breaking up a signal and filtering in a
% loop is equivalent to filtering the entire signal at once. We will
% emulate streaming data by using the filter in a loop:
reset(h2); % Clear history of the filter

yloop = zeros(1,3);          % Pre-allocate memory
for i=1:3,
    yloop(i)=filter(h2,xsec(:,i));
end
yloop
%%
% We verify that yloop(signal filtered by sections) is equal to y1 (entire signal filtered at once).

%% Filtering Multi-Channel Signals
% If the input signal x is a matrix, each column of x is seen by the filter
% as an independent channel.
reset(h2);
x = randn(10,3); % 3-channels signal
y = filter(h2,x)
%%
zf = h2.States
%%
% Notice that the object stores the final conditions of the filter for each
% channel, each colum of the 'States' property corresponding to one
% channel.
