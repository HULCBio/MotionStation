      <h2>Plant Description<a name="1"></a></h2> 
      <p>The following diagram shows a typical process arrangement for a two stage TMP operation. Two pressured refiners operate in
         sequence to produce a mechanical pulp suitable for making newsprint. A primary objective of controlling the TMP plant is to
         regulate the energy applied to the pulp by the electric motors which drive each refiner to derive pulp with good physical
         properties without incurring excess energy costs. A secondary control objective is to regulate the ratio of dry mass flow
         rate to overall mass flow rate (known as consistency) measured at the outlet of each refiner. In practice these objectives
         amount to regulating the primary and secondary refiner motor loads and the primary and secondary refiner constancies subject
         to the following output constraints:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Power on each refiner must be less than maximum rated values rated</li> 
        <li>Maintain the vibration level on the two refiners below a critical level defined to prevent refiner plate clash</li> 
        <li>Limits on measured consistency to prevent blow line plugging and fiber damage.</li> 
      </ul>
      <p>Manipulated variables comprise:&nbsp;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set points to the two gap controllers regulating the distance between the refiner plates</li> 
        <li>Dilution flow rates to the two refiners</li>
        <li>The rpm of the screw feeder.</li> 
      </ul>

%% MPC Supervisory Control of a Two Stage Thermo-mechanical Pulping Process
% This demo illustrates control of a thermo-mechanical pulping (TMP) 
% application using MPC. 

%% Plant Description
% The following diagram shows a typical process arrangement for a two 
% stage TMP operation. Two pressured refiners operate in sequence to
% produce a mechanical pulp suitable for making newsprint.
% A primary objective of controlling the TMP plant is to regulate
% the energy applied to the pulp by the electric motors which drive each 
% refiner to derive pulp with good physical properties without incurring
% excess energy costs. A secondary control objective is to regulate the ratio 
% of dry mass flow rate to overall mass flow rate (known as consistency) 
% measured at the outlet of each refiner. In practice these objectives 
% amount to regulating the primary and secondary refiner
% motor loads and the primary and secondary refiner constancies subject to
% the following output constraints: 
%
% Power on each refiner must be less than maximum rated values rated 
%
% Maintain the vibration level on the two refiners below a critical level
% defined to prevent refiner plate clash
%
% Limits on measured consistency to prevent blow line plugging and fiber damage.

% Manipulated variables comprise:
% set points to the two gap controllers regulating the distance
% between the refiner plates
% the dilution flow rates to the two refiners, 
% and the rpm of the screw feeder. 
%
% Physical limits are also imposed on each of these inputs.

%% Modeling of the TMP plant in Simulink
% The following Simulink model represents a TMP plant and an MPC Controller
% designed for the control objectives described above. The model can be
% opened with
open_system('tmpdemo')

% The MPC controller is represented by an MPC object in the workspace. It 
% can be viewed at the command line as follows:
load MPCtmpdemo;
MPC1

% The controller was built by obtaining a linear plant model TMP model
% from the non-linear TMP Simulink using the MPC GUI (accessible from
% the "Design..." button on the MPC Controller mask) and then tuning the
% MPC controller from within the MPC GUI.
