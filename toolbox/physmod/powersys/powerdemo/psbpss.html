<p><b><font color="#000099">Circuit Description</font></b>
<p>The test system consists of two fully symmetrical areas linked together
by two 230 kV lines of 220 km length. It was specifically designed in [1,2]
to study low frequency electromechanical oscillations in large interconnected
power systems. Despite its small size, it mimics very closely the behavior
of typical systems in actual operation. Each area is equipped with two
identical round rotor generators rated 20 kV/900 MVA. The synchronous machines
have identical parameters [1,2], except for inertias which are H = 6.5s in
area 1 and H = 6.175s in area 2 [1]. Thermal plants having&nbsp; identical
speed regulators are further assumed&nbsp; at all locations, in addition
to fast static exciters with a 200 gain&nbsp; [1,2]. The load is represented
as constant impedances and split between the areas in such a way that area
1 is exporting 413MW to area 2. Since the surge impedance loading of a
single line is about 140 MW [1], the system is somewhat stressed, even in
steady-state. The reference load-flow with M2 considered the slack
machine is such that&nbsp; all generators are producing about 700 MW each.
The results can be seen by opening the Powergui and selecting&nbsp; <font color="#3333FF">Machine
and Load-Flow Initialization.</font> They are slightly different from [1],
because the load voltage profile was improved (made closer to unity)&nbsp;
by installing&nbsp; 187 Mvar more capacitors in each area. In addition,
transmission and generation losses may vary depending on the detail level
in line and generator representation.&nbsp;

<p><b><font color="#000099">1.&nbsp; Small-signal analysis of the systems</font></b>
<p>For an initial understanding of the network behavior, we can simulate
its open-loop responses (PSSmodel = 0) to a 5%-magnitude pulse, applied for
12 cycles at the voltage reference of M1. This test&nbsp; is activated
by&nbsp; opening the timer controlling the voltage reference of M1 and
changing the multiplication factor of the transition times vector from
100 to 1. Similarly, the line fault should be deactivated by changing from
1 to 100 the multiplication factor of the transition times vector in the
"Fault" device and line breackers "Brk1" and "Brk2". After starting the
simulation, the signals responses are visualized by opening the "Machine"
and "System" scopes on the main diagram. All signals show undamped oscillations
leading to unstability. A modal analysis of acceleration powers of the
four machines shows three dominant modes:
<ul>
<li>
(1) An interarea-mode (fn = 0.64Hz , z = -0.026) involving&nbsp; the whole
area 1 against area 2: this mode is clearly observable in the tie-line
power displayed in "System" scope</li>

<li>
(2) Local mode of area 1 (fn = 1.12Hz, z = 0.08) involving this area's&nbsp;
machines against each other</li>

<li>
(3) Local mode of area 2 (fn = 1.16Hz, z = 0.08) involving machine M3 against
M4 (i.e.: the smaller the inertia, the greater the local natural frequency)</li>
</ul>
If one of the two tie-lines is removed by setting the breakers "Brk1" and
"Brk2" in an open position, it is possible to achieve another steady-state
stable equilibrium point with the same generation and load patterns.&nbsp;
This is called a post-contingency network, easy to initialize using the
<font color="#3333FF">Machine
and Load-Flow Initialization</font> button of the Powergui. A modal analysis
of this network's responses to the same 5%-magnitude pulse, applied for
12 cycles at the voltage reference of M1 reveals that, while the two local
modes remain&nbsp; basically unchanged in both frequency and damping (
fn=1.10Hz, z=0.09 in area 1 and&nbsp; fn=1.15Hz, z=0.08 in area 2), the
interarea mode shifts to a much lower frequency with&nbsp; still a negative
damping (i.e.: unstable):<br>
(fn = 0.44Hz, z = -0.015).
<p><b><font color="#000099">2. PSS&nbsp; Tuning</font></b>
<p>The MB-PSS settings were easily selected by varying the center frequency
and gain of each band so as to achieve a nearly flat phase response beween
0.1 Hz and 5 Hz. The Delta w PSS settings are from Kundur [1], with two
changes: a gain increase from 20 to 30 and the addition of a 15-ms transducer
time constant. To see the frequency responses of these PSSs, click on the
<font color="#3333FF">Show
Bode Plot of the PSS</font> icon on the main diagram.
<p><img SRC="im1.jpg" height=624 width=737>
<p>This figure confirms that the MP-BSS phase is effectively flat around
20-40 degrees in the frequency range of interest. The Delta w PSS has an
overall poor phase shape, especially around 1-2 Hz, which makes it unable
to cope with faster local or intermachine modes in multi-unit power plants.
By contrast, the Delta Pa PSS has a good combination of strong gain and
phase advance above 0.3 Hz, although it is unpractical at low frequency
where it shows a 180 deg phase advance, which actually has a destabilizing
effect despite the rather small low-frequency gain. Finally, even though
the low-frequency shaping of the Delta w PSS is satisfactory in overall,
its DC rejection (washout) is not efficient enough, providing five time
less attenuation than the MB-PSS (zoom on the magnitude plot to see this).
<p><b><font color="#000099">3. Small-Signal Performance Assessment (12-cycle
pulse on voltage reference of G1)</font></b>
<p>To simulate the small-signal closed-loop system responses, the transition
times vector of the breakers and fault devices on the main diagram should
be disabled by multiplying it by 100 as above (section 1). Then the timer
block controlling the voltage reference of M1 is activated in the same
way by removing any multiplication by 100, i.e. by changing 100 to 1. Select
the PSS&nbsp; to be simulated by setting PSSmodel = 1,2,3. Start the simulation
and record the variables you want to compare latter. Most of the useful
variables such as the machine speed and terminal voltage are stored in
matrices W and Vt (look inside the "Machines"&nbsp; and "System" blocks
on the main diagram for other variables.) This process&nbsp; was repeated
for the three PSSs. To see the comparisons, double click on icon <font color="#3333FF">Show
results: Step on vref of M1</font>. The figure contains four plots: the
top plot shows the power transfer from area 1 to 2; the second is the M1
speed, then the&nbsp; M1 acceleration power and the bottom plot is the
M1 terminal voltage.
<p><img SRC="im2.jpg" height=625 width=698>
<p>All PSSs do a good job stabilizing the naturally unstable system. However,
it is clear that the MB-PSS is superior to the other two PSSs, providing
significantly more damping to all modes, especially with respect to the
Delta w PSS, whose poor phase/gain shaping above 0.5 Hz highlighted above
shows all its limitations. Damping performance of the interarea-mode with
two ties: MB-PSS: (fn = 0.50Hz, z = 0.30); Delta w: (fn = 0.64Hz, z = 0.25); Delta
Pa: (fn = 0.35Hz, z = 0.30); Damping performance of the interarea-mode with
two tie: MB-PSS:<br>
(fn = 0.40Hz, z = 0.36); Delta w: (fn = 0.43Hz, z = 0.35); Delta
Pa: (fn = 0.23Hz, z = 0.14).
<p><b><font color="#000099">4. Large Signal Performance and Robustness
Assessment (8-cycle, three-phase fault with line outage)</font></b>
<p>In assessing a PSS, small-signal performance is not enough. Good performance
during large perturbations and good robustness with respect to changing
operating conditions are other criteria of an equal importance. The system
responses to a three-phase fault cleared in 8 cycles by opening the breaker
"Brk1" and "Brk2" can be simulated following the same procedure as above.
Without one tie-line, the system can reach a stable operating point in
steady-state, although not every PSS is able to ensure a smooth transition
into this new highly stressed operating point.&nbsp; For comparisons, open
the icon <font color="#3333FF">Show results: 3-phase fault</font>.
<p><img SRC="im3.jpg" height=638 width=783>
<p>You will see that with the Delta Pa PSS, the system lost its synchronism
while the MB-PSS and the Delta W PSS succeed in maintaining stability.
The latter are both very effective in damping the oscillation of the power
transfer. However, the closed-loop oscillation frequency of the MB-PSS
is lower while the Delta w PSS is too slow on recovering the terminal voltage:
this is a bad side effect of an inefficient washout. In addition, the
power acceleration is more damped with the MB-PSS than any other PSS.
