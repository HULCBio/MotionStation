This document describes how to install the MATLAB Common Runtime (MCR). This
release of the MCR supports Windows (XP, 2000), Solaris 5.8 and Debian 
GNU/Linux 3.0.

Applications developed with the MATLAB Compiler require the MCR to run. The
MCR, therefore, must be installed on every target machine. The current
MCR installer is a .ZIP file which contains all the shared librares and 
other code you will need to run applications built with the MATLAB Compiler.

To install the MCR, extract all the files from the ZIP archive into a new
directory. (You've probably at least opened the ZIP file, or you wouldn't
be reading these directions.) Let's call this directory the MCR_ROOT. In
the directions below, I will refer to <MCR_ROOT>. As you are following  the
directions, replace this string with the actual path to the directory you
extracted the ZIP archive into.

Windows:

* Put <MCR_ROOT>/bin/win32 and  <MCR_ROOT>/sys/os/win32 (in that order) on
your PATH environment variable.

Solaris:

* Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to (at least)
  <MCR_ROOT>/bin/sol2:<MCR_ROOT>/sys/os/sol2

Linux:

* Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to (at least)
  <MCR_ROOT>/bin/glnx86:<MCR_ROOT>/sys/os/glnx86
