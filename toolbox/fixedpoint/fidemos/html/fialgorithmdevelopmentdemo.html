      <p>This example shows the development and verification of a simple fixed-point filter algorithm.</p>
      <p>First, the algorithm is developed and simulated in double-precision floating-point.  Second, the algorithm is converted to
         fixed-point by changing the data type of the variables to fixed-point: the M-code for the algorithm itself is identical to
         the floating-point code. Finally, the fixed-point results are compared to the floating-point results and plotted.

%% Fixed-Point Algorithm Development 
% Shows the development and verification of a simple fixed-point algorithm.


%% Simple example of algorithm development
%
% This example shows the development and verification of a simple
% fixed-point filter algorithm.  
% 
% First, the algorithm is developed and simulated in double-precision
% floating-point.  Second, the algorithm is converted to fixed-point by
% changing the data type of the variables to fixed-point: the M-code for
% the algorithm itself is identical to the floating-point code.
% Finally, the fixed-point results are compared to the floating-point
% results and plotted.

%% Floating-point variable definitions
% We develop our algorithm in double-precision floating-point.

b = [ 0.25 0.5      0.25    ];
a = [ 1    0.09375  0.28125 ];
x = 0.5*ones(40,1);
y = zeros(size(x));
z = [0;0];

%% Datatype-independent algorithm
for k=1:length(x)
    y(k) =  b(1)*x(k) + z(1);
    z(1) = (b(2)*x(k) + z(2)) - a(2)*y(k);
    z(2) =  b(3)*x(k)         - a(3)*y(k);
end

%% Save the floating-point result
ydouble = y;

%% Fixed-point variable definitions
% We convert variables to fixed-point and run the algorithm again. 
%
% In this example, the numeric type of the state variable z is chosen so
% that it will hold the products in full-precision. However, in some
% applications, the numeric type of the states is cast back to the numeric
% type of the data x.

%   fi(Data, Signed, WordLength, FractionLength)
b = fi(b, 1, 8, 6);
a = fi(a, 1, 8, 6);

x = fi(x, 1, 8, 6);
y = fi(zeros(size(x)), 1, 8, 6);
z = fi([0;0], 1, 16, 12);

%% Same datatype-independent algorithm
for k=1:length(x)
    y(k) =  b(1)*x(k) + z(1);
    z(1) = (b(2)*x(k) + z(2)) - a(2)*y(k);
    z(2) =  b(3)*x(k)         - a(3)*y(k);
end
%%
% In this example, we have redefined the fixed-point variables with the
% same names as the floating-point so that we could inline the algorithm
% code for clarity.  However, it is a better practice to enclose the
% algorithm code in an M-file function that could be called with either
% floating-point or fixed-point variables.  See |filimitcycledemo.m| for an
% example of writing and using a datatype-agnostic algorithm.

%% Plot floating-point vs. fixed-point
n = (0:length(y)-1)';
plot(n,ydouble,'.-b',n,y,'.-r')
legend('double','fixed-point')
xlabel('n (samples)'); ylabel('amplitude')

%% Plot the error
e = double(lsb(y));
plot(n,double(y)-ydouble,'.-r', ...
     [n(1) n(end)],[e/2 e/2],'c', ...
     [n(1) n(end)],[-e/2 -e/2],'c')
text(n(end),e/2,'+1/2 LSB','HorizontalAlignment','right','VerticalAlignment','bottom')
text(n(end),-e/2,'-1/2 LSB','HorizontalAlignment','right','VerticalAlignment','top')
xlabel('n (samples)'); ylabel('error')

%% Simulink
%
% If you have Simulink and Simulink Fixed Point, you can run this model,
% which is the equivalent of the algorithm above.  The output, y_sim is
% a fixed-point variable equal to the variable y calculated above in
% M-code.
%
% As in the M-code, the fixed-point parameters in the blocks can be
% modified to match an actual system; these have been set to match the
% M-code in the example above.  Double-click on the blocks to see the
% settings.

if license('test','Fixed-Point_Blocks')

% Set up the From Workspace variable
x_sim.time = n;
x_sim.signals.values = x;
x_sim.signals.dimensions = 1;

% Run the simulation
sim('fitdf2filter_demo')

% Open the model
fitdf2filter_demo

% Verify that the Simulink results are the same as the M-file
isequal(y, y_sim)

end

%% Assumptions made for this example
%
% In order to simplify the example, we have taken the default math
% parameters: round-to-nearest, saturate on overflow, full precision
% products and sums.  We can modify all of these parameters to match an
% actual system.
%
% In this example, we have concentrated on rounding errors and not
% explored the effects of overflow.  We are purposefully using low
% precision so that the effects of the quantization will be evident in
% the plots.
%
% The settings were chosen as a starting point in algorithm development.
% Save a copy of this M-file, start playing with the parameters, and see
% what effects they have on the output.  How does the algorithm behave
% with random input?  See the help for fi, fimath, and numerictype for
% information on how to set other parameters, such as rounding mode, and
% overflow mode.
