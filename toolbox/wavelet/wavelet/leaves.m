function [tn,K] = leaves(t,varargin)
%LEAVES Determine terminal nodes.
%   N = LEAVES(T) returns a column vector N, which 
%   contains the indices of terminal nodes of the tree T.
%
%   The nodes are ordered from left to right as in tree T.   
%
%   [N,K] = LEAVES(T,'s') or [N,K] = LEAVES(T,'sort')
%   returns sorted indices.
%   M = N(K) are the indices reordered as in tree T,
%   from left to right.
%
%   N = LEAVES(T,'dp') returns a matrix N, which contains
%   the depths and positions of terminal nodes.
%   N(i,1) is the depth of i-th terminal node.
%   N(i,2) is the position of i-th terminal node.
%
%   [N,K] = LEAVES(T,'sdp') or [N,K] = LEAVES(T,'pds') or
%   [N,K] = LEAVES(T,'sortdp') or [N,K] = LEAVES(T,'pdsort') 
%   return sorted nodes.
