% RTDX (tm) Blocks      
%
% RTDX Blocks are a feature of the Embedded Target for the TI 
% TMS320C6000 (tm) DSP Platform.  These source and sink blocks  allow you
% to include Real-Time Data Exchange (tm) commuication  in the data paths
% in your generated code. 
% 
% To access RTDX Blocks, type 'rtdxblocks'.  Copy the blocks from the
% library into your Simulink model wherever you want to obtain a signal
% from, or send a signal to, an RTDX channel.  While the generated
% application is running,  you can write to and read from the RTDX channels
% using the Link for RTDX.
