      <p>This demonstration shows an example of coverage analysis applied to a simple design problem and compares the coverage requirements
         for different metrics.

      <h2>Example Model<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>In this example, use an Embedded MATLAB Function within a Stateflow model as a framework to execute a simple algorithm for
         determining when two rectangles intersect.
      </p>
      <p>The algorithm uses coordinates for the rectangles in the form of an origin, a height, and width combined together in a four
         element vector.  The algorithm takes two rectangle vectors as inputs and returns a single Boolean output to indicate if the
         rectangles intersect.
      </p>
      <p>NOTE: The commands in this demonstration are for manipulating user dialogs and can be ignored.  Normally you interact graphically
         with a dialog.

% design problem and compares the coverage requirements for different metrics.

%% Example Model
% In this example, use an Embedded MATLAB Function within a Stateflow model as 
% a framework to execute a simple algorithm for determining when two rectangles 
% intersect.
%  
% The algorithm uses coordinates for the rectangles in the form of an 
% origin, a height, and width combined together in a four element vector.  The
% algorithm takes two rectangle vectors as inputs and returns a single Boolean
% output to indicate if the rectangles intersect.
%  
% NOTE: The commands in this demonstration are for manipulating user dialogs 
% and can be ignored.  Normally you interact graphically with a dialog.

%%
% The logic of this algorithm is implemented in the M code copied below.  
% The first if statement checks for Y axis overlap, that is, if the first
% rectangle is completely below the second or the second is completely below the 
% first.  The second if statement checks for X axis overlap, that is, if the
% first rectangle is completely to the right of the second or the second is
% completely to the right of the first.
%
% Both Y and X axis overlap must be present for the rectangles to intersect. If
% Y axis overlap is not present X axis overlap is not checked. This logic can be
% structured using only a single if statement or broken into the following if
% statements.
%  
%    out = 1;
%  
%    if (top1 < bottom2 || top2 < bottom1)
%       out = 0;
%    else
%        if (right1 < left2 || right2 < left1)
%            out = 0;
%        end
%    end

%% Statement coverage requirements

% strongly dependent on the structure of the coded implementation. Complete
% statement coverage requires at least two tests.  One test should not overlap 
% in the Y axis resulting in execution of the first |out = 0;| statement.  The
% other test should overlap in the Y axis but not in the X axis resulting in
% execution of the second |out = 0;| statement.

%% Decision coverage requirements
% Full decision coverage requires a true and a false outcome for each if
% statement. Full decision coverage executes the else statement for each if
% statement (explicit or implied), which improves the likelihood of finding
% errors.
%
% This example requires three test cases for full decision coverage. A single 
% test case tests the true outcome for the top level if statement. Two test
% cases test the true and false outcomes for the nested if statement when
% the top level if statement is false. 
%  
% Notice that both |if| keywords are colored green because they have both been
% tested true and false.

%% Condition and MCDC coverage requirements
% Full condition and MCDC coverage require 5 test cases.  This level of coverage
% is less sensitive to the modifications that result when if statements are
% replaced with && and || operators in the conditions.  The coverage
% requirements to fully satisfy this metric would be the same even if there were
% only a single if statement.
%   
% These test cases have a clear symmetry with the two test cases for statement
% coverage. Each is an X or Y axis mirror image of a statement coverage test
% case. This insures independent verification of both conditions in each of the
% if statements.
%  
% Notice that the entire expression for each if statement is colored green.
