</pre><h2>Coverage Data Objects<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>Frequently, you want to extract information for a specific subsystem or block in the model. A coverage data object is contains
         series of arrays, one for each metric analyzed.  Access this data using structure style references.  For example, access raw
         decision coverage data with the following command:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">data.metrics.decision

</pre><h2>Extracting coverage information<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>Individual elements within the raw coverage data correspond to specific coverage points within the model.  The order of these
         points is based on the location of blocks within the Simulink and Stateflow hierarchy. Several access commands allow data
         to be extracted for a specific block or subsystem.
      </p>
      <h2>Extract decision coverage information<a name="7"></a></h2>
      <p>Use the <tt>decisioninfo</tt> command to extract decision coverage information for individual Simulink blocks or Stateflow objects.
      </p>
      <p>The following command extracts a coverage array for the entire model. The first element is the number of coverage points satisfied
         for the model; the second element is the total number of coverage points for the model.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">cov = decisioninfo(data,<span class="string">'cv_small_controller'</span>)

</pre><p>Quantitative coverage information is available for every point in the hierarchy that contains or has coverage points. Textual

      </p>
      <p>The <tt>conditioninfo</tt> command for extracting coverage information is very similar to the <tt>decisioninfo</tt> command.  It normally returns information about an object and all its descendents, but can take a third argument that indicates
         if descendents should be ignored.  It can also return a second output containing descriptions of each condition.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">cov = conditioninfo(data,<span class="string">'cv_small_controller/Gain/Logic'</span>)

    falseCnts: 57

</pre><h2>Extracting MCDC information<a name="13"></a></h2>
      <p>MCDC coverage analyzes the objects in a model that define Boolean expressions. MCDC coverage is satisfied for a condition
         within a Boolean expression if there are two evaluations of the expression such that only that condition changes value and
         results in changing the value of the entire expression.
      </p>
      <p>In some cases Boolean expressions are short circuited so that the remaining conditions are not evaluated.  The coverage analysis
         permits conditions to change from known values to unknown values and vice versa and still treats the condition as unchanged
         for purposes of MCDC analysis.
      </p>
      <p>In this example, the logical AND block is analyzed for MCDC coverage with an <tt>mcdcinfo</tt> command. This command uses the same syntax as <tt>conditioninfo</tt> and <tt>decisioninfo</tt> commands.

    trueRslt
    falseRslt

</pre><h2>Extracting lookup table coverage<a name="14"></a></h2>
      <p>Lookup table coverage records the frequency that lookup occurs for each interpolation interval.  Valid intervals for coverage
         purposes also include values less than the smallest breakpoint and values greater than the largest breakpoint.  For consistency
         with the other commands this information is returned as a pair of counts with the number of intervals that executed and the
         total number of intervals.
      </p>
      <p>A second output argument causes <tt>tableinfo</tt> to return the execution counts for all interpolation intervals.  If the table has M-by-N output values, execution counts
         are returned in an M+1-by-N+1 matrix.
      </p>
      <p>A third output argument causes <tt>tableinfo</tt> to return the counts where the input was exactly equal to the breakpoint.  This is returned in a cell array of vectors, one
         for each dimension in the table.

%% Extracting Detailed Information from Coverage Data
% This demonstration explains how coverage information for a model is bundled
% in the cvdata object and how utility commands can extract information from it
% for an individual subsystem, block, or Stateflow object.

%   Copyright 1990-2003 The MathWorks, Inc.
%   $Revision: 1.1.6.1 $  $Date: 2003/09/18 18:07:40 $

%% An example model for analysis
% This example illustrates command line access of coverage data for a small
% model that contains aspects of all the supported coverage metrics. The model
% contains some blocks with coverage points at the root level and others at the
% subsystem level.
%  
% Use the following commands to open the model 'cv_small_controller' and its
% subsystem 'Gain.'  

open_system('cv_small_controller');
open_system('cv_small_controller/Gain');

%% Generating coverage data and an HTML report
% Simulate the model with the |cvsim| command. This command captures coverage
% data as a side-effect and returns this information in a cvdata object. The
% cvdata object is a MATLAB object that references the internal data stored in
% the coverage tool and the model data structures that produce that data.  
%  

testObj = cvtest('cv_small_controller');
testObj.settings.decision = 1;
testObj.settings.condition = 1;
testObj.settings.mcdc = 1;
testObj.settings.tableExec = 1;
testObj.settings.sigrange = 1;
data = cvsim(testObj)

%%
% Process the coverage data returned from a |cvsim| command with the report
% generation command |cvhtml|. The resulting report is a convenient
% representation of model coverage for the entire model.
%  

cvhtml('tempfile.html',data);

%% Coverage Data Objects
% Frequently, you want to extract information for a specific subsystem or block
% in the model. A coverage data object is contains series of arrays, one for
% each metric analyzed.  Access this data using structure style references.  For
% example, access raw decision coverage data with the following command:
%  

data.metrics.decision

%%
% Access raw condition coverage with the following command:
%  

data.metrics.condition


%% Extracting coverage information
% Individual elements within the raw coverage data correspond to specific 
% coverage points within the model.  The order of these points is based on the 
% location of blocks within the Simulink and Stateflow hierarchy. Several access 
% commands allow data to be extracted for a specific block or subsystem.

%% Extract decision coverage information 
% Use the |decisioninfo| command to extract decision coverage information for
% individual Simulink blocks or Stateflow objects. 
%  
% The following command extracts a coverage array for the entire model. The 
% first element is the number of coverage points satisfied for the model; the
% second element is the total number of coverage points for the model.  
%  

cov = decisioninfo(data,'cv_small_controller')
percent = 100*cov(1)/cov(2)

%%
% Retrieve coverage information for the 'Saturation' block using the full path
% to that block.  Provide a second return argument for textual descriptions of
% the coverage points within that block. 
% 
%  

[blkCov, description] = decisioninfo(data,'cv_small_controller/Saturation')

decision1 = description.decision(1).text
out_1a = description.decision(1).outcome(1).text
count_1a = description.decision(1).outcome(1).executionCount
out_1b = description.decision(1).outcome(2).text
count_1b = description.decision(1).outcome(2).executionCount

%%
% Quantitative coverage information is available for every point in the 
% hierarchy that contains or has coverage points. Textual descriptions 
% are generated only for objects that have coverage points themselves. For 
% example, invoke |decisioninfo| for the virtual subsystem Gain, and the
% description return value is empty. 
%  

[blkCov, description] = decisioninfo(data,'cv_small_controller/Gain')

%%
% In some cases an object has internal coverage points but also contains 
% descendents with additional coverage points.  Coverage information normally
% includes all the descendents unless a third argument for ignoring descendents
% is set to 1.
%  

subsysOnlycov = decisioninfo(data,'cv_small_controller/Gain',1)

%%
% The |decisioninfo| command also works with block handles, Stateflow IDs, and 
% Stateflow API objects. If an object has no decision coverage, the command
% returns empty outputs.
%  

blkHandle = get_param('cv_small_controller/Saturation','Handle')
blkCov = decisioninfo(data,blkHandle)
missingBlkCov = decisioninfo(data,'cv_small_controller/Sine1')

%% Extracting condition information 
% Condition coverage indicates if the logical inputs to Boolean expressions
% have been evaluated to both true and false.  In Simulink, conditions are the
% inputs to logical operations.
%  
% The |conditioninfo| command for extracting coverage information is very
% similar to the |decisioninfo| command.  It normally returns information about
% an object and all its descendents, but can take a third argument that indicates
% if descendents should be ignored.  It can also return a second output
% containing descriptions of each condition.
%  

cov = conditioninfo(data,'cv_small_controller/Gain/Logic')
[cov, desc] = conditioninfo(data,'cv_small_controller/Gain/Logic');
desc(1)
desc(2)

%% Extracting MCDC information 
% MCDC coverage analyzes the objects in a model that define Boolean expressions.
% MCDC coverage is satisfied for a condition within a Boolean expression if 
% there are two evaluations of the expression such that only that condition 
% changes value and results in changing the value of the entire expression.
%  
% In some cases Boolean expressions are short circuited so that the remaining
% conditions are not evaluated.  The coverage analysis permits conditions
% to change from known values to unknown values and vice versa and still
% treats the condition as unchanged for purposes of MCDC analysis.
%   
% In this example, the logical AND block is analyzed for MCDC coverage with an
% |mcdcinfo| command. This command uses the same syntax as |conditioninfo| and
% |decisioninfo| commands.
%  

[cov, desc] = mcdcinfo(data,'cv_small_controller/Gain/Logic')
desc.condition

%% Extracting lookup table coverage 
% Lookup table coverage records the frequency that lookup occurs for each
% interpolation interval.  Valid intervals for coverage purposes also include
% values less than the smallest breakpoint and values greater than the largest
% breakpoint.  For consistency with the other commands this information is 
% returned as a pair of counts with the number of intervals that executed and 
% the total number of intervals.
%  
% A second output argument causes |tableinfo| to return the execution counts 
% for all interpolation intervals.  If the table has M-by-N output values,
% execution counts are returned in an M+1-by-N+1 matrix.
%  
% A third output argument causes |tableinfo| to return the counts where the input
% was exactly equal to the breakpoint.  This is returned in a cell array of 
% vectors, one for each dimension in the table.
%  

[cov,execCnts,brkEq] = tableinfo(data, 'cv_small_controller/Gain/Gain Table')

%% Extracting signal range information 
% Signal range coverage records the smallest and largest value of Simulink 
% block outputs and Stateflow data objects.  The |sigrangeinfo| command returns 
% two return arguments for the minimum and maximum values, respectively.
%  
% The |sigrangeinfo| command works only for leaf blocks that perform a
% computation; otherwise the command returns empty arguments.
%  

[sigMin, sigMax] = sigrangeinfo(data,'cv_small_controller/Gain/Logic')  % Leaf
[sigMin, sigMax] = sigrangeinfo(data,'cv_small_controller/Gain')        % Nonleaf
