      <h2>Demonstration model for coverage purposes<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>This demonstration uses the sf_car model to explain the settings and options to accumulate coverage. Inside this model is
         a signal builder block that is configured with four sets of simulation data.  By default the simulation uses the first set
         of data.
      </p>
      <p>NOTE: Commands that manipulate user dialogs in this demonstration can be       ignored. They simulate user interactions with
         the dialog.
