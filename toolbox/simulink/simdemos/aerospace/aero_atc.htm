<h3><a name="DemoDescription"></a>Model Description</h3>

<p>This model is a conceptual air traffic control (ATC) radar
simulation based on the radar range equation. To make parameters
easier to change and easier to determine their values, a GUI is
supplied with this model. Radar and weather parameters may be
changed from this GUI. While simulating, the effects of these
parameters can be seen on the scope display which shows the
actual aircraft range in yellow and the estimated aircraft range
from the radar in magenta. Another output that can be viewed is
the calculated signal to noise ratio (SNR) is compared to the
ideal SNR. Ideal SNR is also specified from the GUI. The result
is shown in the display block and will be either 1 (SNR&gt;=
ideal SNR) or 0 (SNR&lt; ideal SNR).</p>

<p>Within this model, Simulink and Stateflow are used. The model
is divided into three subsystems, radar, aircraft,
and weather.
Using subsystems is helpful in two ways: the model is organized
and easier to understand and the work can be split between
multiple engineers by subsystems. The a Stateflow machine labeled
check SNR performs the logic comparing calculated SNR is compared
to the ideal SNR and output data based on this comparison. </p>

<p>You can <a href="matlab:aero_atcscript('step2');">run
the simulation</a> to determine if the radar can pick up the
aircraft by the output on the scope. Using the GUI, the radar and
the weather parameters can be altered and will change the range
where the aircraft can be &quot;seen&quot;.</p>

<h3><a name="Issues"></a>Design Issues</h3>

<p>Radar systems are designed for a specific purpose and can very
seldom be used for other applications effectively. Each new radar
specification requires a &quot;re-design&quot;. When designing a
radar for an application, there are a number of parameters which
shape the design. Some of these parameters are contained or
derived logically from the customer specification. Others are
selected arbitrarily using the design engineer's best judgement.
This is the first approximate solution for the system design.
From here, continual refinement of the design parameters takes
place until an optimum design is reached. If any changes occur in
the customer specification, it could cause a need to the whole
design process over from the beginning.</p>

<h3><a name="Spec"></a>Design Specification</h3>

<p>We're interested in performing conceptual design for a
ground-based air traffic control (ATC) radar. Let's take a look
at a potential customer specification.</p>

<p><img src="images/atc_Image2.gif" hspace="220" width="345"
height="220"></p>

<p>This is an example of a customer specification upon which a
design process would be based. The customer, possibly the FAA,
provides some basic requirements for the radar design leaving a
number of parameter selections up to the design engineer. </p>

<p>It should be noted that some of the logically derived
parameters are dependent on the assumption of the engineer and
would need to be re-calculated each time the best-judgement
parameters are optimized. This problem lends itself well to
simulation. By using Simulink and Stateflow, the design engineer
has the analysis capability of having time-varying design cases
for his Monte Carlo test cases, i.e.: aircraft cross-sections and
locations, weather cross-sections and locations.</p>

<h3><a name="TMW"></a>MathWorks' Products in the Design Process</h3>

<p>Here's how the MathWorks products fit the job of conceptual
radar design. </p>

<p><img src="images/atc_Image1.gif" hspace="150" width="453"
height="295"></p>

<p>Using the customer specification and the radar range equations
along with equations describing the physics of the system, a
model is built in MATLAB, Simulink, and Stateflow. Using the
model in batch mode (see <a href="matlab:aero_atcscript('step3');">sim</a>
command), those best-judgement parameters can be optimized for
various conditions, weather,aircraft, etc in a Monte Carlo
situation. The resultant is optimized radar parameter that can be
used to build a block diagram model of the full radar system for
further system analysis in Simulink with the Signal Processing blockset. </p>
