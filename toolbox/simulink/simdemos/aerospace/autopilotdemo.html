<p>This demonstration shows how to use Stateflow and function-call subsystems to model an autopilot for the F14 model.</p>
 

<p>To simulate a landing, set the initial altitude to 1200 by double-clicking the Setup Landing block. Make sure that the ILS signal is ON and the reset signal is OFF. The controller will automatically enter glide-slope control when the plane initially crosses the target glide-slope line. The simulation stop time is set to 150 seconds.</p>

<p>To simulate a set point change, first adjust the desired altitude and vertical speed, then set the update signal to ON to force the new set point into the controller. The control logic will automatically transition to the altitude climb mode and back to the altitude hold mode, as needed. Change the simulation stop time to "inf" for an indefinite flight time.</p>
