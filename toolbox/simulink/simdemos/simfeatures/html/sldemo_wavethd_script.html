      <h1>Digital Waveform Generation: Approximating a Sine Wave</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>Real-Time direct digital synthesis of analog waveforms using embedded processors and digital signal processors (DSPs) connected
            to digital-to-analog converters (DACs) is becoming pervasive even in the smallest systems.  Developing waveforms for use in
            embedded systems or laboratory instruments can be streamlined using the tight integration of MATLAB and Simulink.  You can
            develop and analyze the waveform generation algorithm and its associated data at your desktop before implementing it with
            Real-Time Workshop on target hardware.  This demonstration goes through some of the main steps needed to design and evaluate
            a sine wave data table for use in digital waveform synthesis applications in embedded systems and arbitrary waveform generation
            instruments.  (Open the model: <a href="matlab:sldemo_tonegen">matlab:sldemo_tonegen</a>)
         </p>
         <p>When feasible, the most accurate way to digitally synthesize a sine wave is to compute the full precision sin() function directly
            for each time step, folding omega*t into the interval 0 to 2*pi.  In real-time systems, the computational burden is typically
            too large to permit this approach.  One popular way around this obstacle is to use a table of values to approximate the behavior
            of the sin() function, either from 0 to 2*pi, or even half wave or quarter wave data to leverage symmetry.
         </p>
         <p>Tradeoffs to consider include algorithm efficiency, data ROM size required, and accuracy/spectral purity of the implementation.
            Similar analysis is needed when performing your own waveform designs.  The table data and look-up algorithm alone do not determine
            performance in the field.  Additional considerations such as the accuracy and stability of the real-time clock, and digital
            to analog converter are also needed in order to assess overall performance.  The Signal Processing Toolbox and the Signal
            Processing Blockset complement the capabilities of MATLAB and Simulink for work in this area.

      <h2>Create a table in double precision floating point<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>The following commands make a 256 point sine wave and  measure its total harmonic distortion when sampled first on the points
         and then by jumping with a delta of 2.5 points per step using linear interpolation.  For frequency-based applications, spectral
         purity can be more important than absolute error in the table.
      </p>
      <p>This M-file  <a href="matlab:edit('ssinthd.m')">matlab:edit('ssinthd.m')</a> is the core function in this demo. It is used for calculating total harmonic distortion (THD) for digital sine wave generation
         with or without interpolation.  This THD algorithm proceeds over an integral number of waves to achieve accurate results.
         The number of wave cycles used is A.  Since the step size 'delta' is A/B and traversing A waves will hit all points in the
         table at least one time, which is needed to accurately find the average THD across a full cycle.
      </p>
      <p>The relationship used to calculate THD is:</p><pre>    THD = (ET - EF) / ET</pre><p>where ET = total energy, and       EF = fundamental energy</p>
      <p>The energy difference between ET and EF is spurious energy.</p><pre class="codeinput">N = 256;

         This model compares the output of the floating point tables to the sin() function.  As expected from the THD calculations,
         the linear interpolation has a lower error than the direct table lookup in comparison to the sin() function.

          Total harmonic distortion of the 24-bit fractional fixed point table is measured at each step size, moving through it D points
