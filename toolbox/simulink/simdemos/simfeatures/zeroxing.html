<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Zero Crossing Demonstration </p>
<p>This demonstration shows how zero crossings work in Simulink.  In this model, 
three shifted sine waves are fed into an absolute value block and saturation block.
At exactly t = 5, the output of the switch block changes from the absolute value 
to the saturation block.  Zero crossings in Simulink will automatically detect exactly
when the switch block changes its output, and the solver will step to the exact 
time that the event happens.  This can be seen by examining the output in the scope. </p>
