% Demonstration models.
%   busdemo      - Bus block.
%   combfilter   - Data Typing with filter.
%   datatypedemo - Data Typing demonstration.
%   enablesub    - Enabled subsysytems.
%   enabsubs     - Enabled subsystems.
%   logdemo      - Logic blocks.
%   mergedemo    - Merge block.

%   zeroxing     - Zero-crossing detection.
%
% Execute the MATLAB command "demo simulink" to see a menu of all demos
% and models in this directory.  The demo menu is also available by
% opening the Demos block in the main Simulink block library 
% (which is displayed by typing "simulink" at the MATLAB command line or
% by pressing the Simulink toolbar icon).
%
% Demos can also be run by typing their names at the MATLAB command line.
%
% Support routines and data files.
%   mergefcn.m      - S-function for mergedemo.
%   spriorityfcn.m  - Support for prioritydemo.
