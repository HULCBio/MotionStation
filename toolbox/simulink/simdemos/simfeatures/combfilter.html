<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Data Typing Filter Demonstration </p>
<p>This demonstration shows how a filter can be applied to signals of different data types using
standard Simulink blocks.  In this example, a signal with some noise on it is produced.  This 
signal is then fed into a filter as a single precision data type and a standard double data type.
The output from the filter for each signal is then compared and the error is displayed on the 
scope. </p>
