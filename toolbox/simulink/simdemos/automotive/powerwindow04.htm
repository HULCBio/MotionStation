<p>
In moving to an implementation, additional effects that may affect the control have to
be accounted for. This model includes phenomena such as signal conditioning to measure
the armature current and quantization of the measurement.

<p>
You must install SimMechanics, SimPowerSystems, the DSP Blockset, and
the Fixed Point Blockset to run this power window demo.
