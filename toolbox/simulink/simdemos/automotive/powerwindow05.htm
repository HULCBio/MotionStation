<h3><font color="#990000">Simulink Power Window Controller With CAN Communication</font></h3>

<p>
The commands to control window movement are typically communicated over a controller
area network (CAN). In this model, the switches that may be located in the center
console of the vehicle and that produce the commands are included.

<p>
You must install SimMechanics, SimPowerSystems, the DSP Blockset,
the Fixed Point Blockset, and xPC Target to run this power window demo.
