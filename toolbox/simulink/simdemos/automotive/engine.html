<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Engine Timing Simulation</p>

<p>This demonstration shows how to use Triggered subsystems to model engine timing. Different subsystems in the diagram  model the mathmatical representation of various automotive systems, include the following.</p>

<ul>
<li>Throttle & Manifold
<li>Compression
<li>Combustion
<li>Vehicle Dynamics
<li>Valve Timing
</ul>

<p>The valve timing subsystem generates a signal that triggers the Compression subsystem twice per revolution of the crank (calculated from the crank speed.)

<p>A throttle schedule (in angles) from the Step block labeled "throttle" on the left side of the diagram drives the simulation.</p>

<p>After running the simulation, the Scopes show the engine speed and the throttle angle compared to the load torque.
