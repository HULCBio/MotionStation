<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Pendulum with Two Joint</p>

<p>This system models a double pendulum system where
the rest state has the pendulums balanced to hang
at right angles to one another </p>
<p>Associated with the demo is an animation function that
will automatically open a figure window and display to it. </p>
<p>Try experimenting with different initial conditions for
alpha and gamma to see some remarkable behavior.
This system exhibits very strong nonlinear coupling. </p>
