<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Toilet bowl blushing animation</p>

<p>This demonstration shows how to model the dynamics of a flushing toilet. The associated animation provides a graphical display of the tank as it empties and refills, based on user-defined tank parameters. </p>

<p>The toilet flushes at the start of the simulation and can be reflushed by pressing the FLUSH button on the GUI. The simulation must be manually stop via either the GUI or the Simulink diagram.</p>

<p>When the simulation is stopped, a plot is generated showing the water height and the state of the two valves.</p>
