<p  style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Friction with hard stops model</p>

<p>This demonstration shows how to model friction in Simulink. The two integrators in the model calculate the velocity and position of the system, which is then used in the Friction Model to calculate the friction force.</p>

<p>Running the simulation shows the initial condition response  on the Scope. </p>
