<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Quaternion rotation animation</p>

<p>This demonstration shows how three degree of freedom Euler rotations are related to Quaternion rotations (Euler Parameters). Clicking on Yaw, Pitch or Roll rotates the aircraft in heading (Psi), pitch (Theta), and roll (Phi), respectively.</p> 
                                      
<p>On the animation, the blue line represents the axis of a single simple rotation that brings the aircraft back to wings level flying north. The quaternion representation of the aircraft is shown below the Euler angles.  Changing Azimuth and Elevation changes the "blue line" axis of rotation and changing Beta changes the amount the aircraft is rotated about this axis. Azimuth is defined as a rotation about the "down" axis and Elevation is defined as a rotation about the intermediate "east" axis. The "blue line" originates from the "down" axis. Clicking on reset rotates the aircraft through the angle Beta to wings level flying north. It is also possible to change the viewing angle by clicking and dragging the axes.</p>
                                        
<p>The Dynamic radio button changes the Euler angles to body rates of rotation.The dynamic rates of rotation (P,Q,R) are body fixed rates that take place about the roll, pitch and yaw axes respectively.  The rates are given in Degrees/Frame and can automatically be set to zero using the Reset button.</p>

<p>The Static button allows you to return to the Euler angle display. </p>
