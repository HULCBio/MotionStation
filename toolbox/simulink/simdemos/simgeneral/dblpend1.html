<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Pendulum with One Joint</p>

<p>This system models a double pendulum system where
the rest state has both pendulums hanging vertically. </p>
<p>Associated with the demo is an animation function that
will automatically open a figure window and display to it. </p>
<p>Try experimenting with different initial conditions for
alpha and gamma to see the unusal coupling effects. </p>
