<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Spring-Mass System Simulation</p>

<p>This system models a simple spring-mass-damper
system with a periodically varying forcing function. </p>
<p>Associated with the demo is an animation function that
will automatically open a figure window and display to it. </p>
<p>Try experimenting with different initial conditions and
different settings for the forcing function. </p>
