<p>This demonstration introduces you to the Simulink Profiler.
The Simulink profiler collects performance data while simulating your model and
generates a report, called a <i>simulation report.</i> The profile is useful to
find out how much time Simulink spends executing each block in your model. The
report shows which parts of your model require the most time to simulate and
where to focus model optimization efforts. 
Now we will step through a simple demonstration using the f14 model.</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="matlab:open_system('f14');">Open f14 model</a>.</li>
 <li>Make sure the current folder is writeable.</li>
 <li>Make the <a href="matlab:set_param('f14','profile','on');">Profiler</a> active
     by clicking under the Tools menu in Simulink. </li>
 <li><a href="matlab:sim('f14')">Run the simulation</a>. While the simulation runs, the profiler
     is collecting data for the report.</li>
 <li>Once the simulation is done, an html report is created.</li>
</ul>


<p>The generated report consists of two HTML files: a detail
file and a summary file. Simulink stores the summary and detail files in
MATLAB's working directory and displays the summary file in the MATLAB help
viewer when the simulation ends. For this example, notice that the 
<B>Pilot G force Scope (Output)</B> uses more time than any other 
individual block. If the scope figures were closed during execution, 
you can expect the simulation to run faster.

Hyperlinks in the summary enable you to review the detailed timing information
 for each function. </p>
