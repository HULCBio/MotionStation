Assembly Code employed within  The MathWorks, Inc.'s Embedded Target
for TI(tm)--C6000(tm) DSP


Important - Read carefully. If you do not agree with the following
terms you may not use the software programs or associated
documentation for any purpose:

This Software License Agreement (or "Agreement") is a legal agreement
between you (either an individual or entity) and Texas Instruments
Incorporated ("TI"). The "Licensed Materials" subject to this
Agreement include the TI C and Assembly code incorporated within The
MathWorks, Inc.'s Embedded Target for TI C6000 DSP. Any applications
included with the "Licensed Materials" are specifically designed and
licensed for execution solely and exclusively on semiconductor devices
manufactured by or for TI. By installing, copying or otherwise using
the Licensed Materials, you agree to abide by the terms of this
Agreement.


This Agreement is displayed for you to read prior to using the
Licensed Materials. If you choose not to agree with these provisions,
do not use the Licensed Materials.  Your breach of this Software
License Agreement shall also be considered a breach of The MathWorks,
Inc. Software License Agreement.

1.      Intellectual Property, Title and Limited License Grant - The
Licensed Materials are protected by copyright laws, international
copyright treaties, and trade secret laws, as well as other
intellectual property laws and treaties. The Licensed Materials are
licensed, not sold to you, and can only be used in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. TI retains title and ownership of the
Licensed Materials, including all intellectual property rights in the
Licensed Materials and all copies of the Licensed Materials.

a.      Host License - Subject to the terms of this Agreement, TI
hereby grants to you a limited, non-exclusive license to use the
Licensed Materials to generate applications that execute solely and
exclusively on semiconductor devices manufactured by or for TI. Use of
any software applications generated using the Licensed Materials on
semiconductor devices manufactured by or for an entity other than TI
is a material breach of this Agreement. It is also a material breach
of this license to use the Licensed Materials to assist in the design,
development or verification of a device that is instruction set
compatible with, or functionally equivalent to, a TI semiconductor
device.

b.      Target License - The Licensed Materials may include TI
proprietary software programs in an object code format that are
designed specifically for use in target applications. TI hereby grants
to you a limited, non-exclusive license to reproduce and distribute an
unlimited number of copies of such programs solely and exclusively for
use with semiconductor devices manufactured by or for TI. The Licensed
Materials may also include libraries or applications software in a
source code format. You may use these programs to create modified or
derivative programs that may be reproduced and distributed by you
provided that such programs execute solely and exclusively on
semiconductor devices manufactured by or for TI and provided further
that such programs are distributed only in an object code or
executable format. You may not distribute, publish, rent, lease or
sub-license the Licensed Materials, or any portion or derivative
thereof in a source code format or transfer or assign this Agreement
without TI's prior written permission.

c.      Termination - This license is effective until terminated.
Without prejudice to any other rights, TI may terminate your right to
use the Licensed Materials and any applications generated using the
Licensed Materials under this Agreement if you fail to comply with the
terms of this Agreement. In such event, you shall destroy all copies
of the Licensed Materials, including all portions and derivatives
thereof, in your possession, custody or control.

2.      Intellectual Property Rights - The Licensed Materials contain
copyrighted material, trade secrets and other proprietary information.
In order to protect the Licensed Materials, and except as specifically
permitted by statute by a provision that cannot be waived by contract,
you may not unlock, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or
otherwise translate any binary or object code versions of the software
programs included in the Licensed Materials to human-perceivable form.
You also agree that you will use your best efforts to prevent your
employees and contractors from unlocking, decompiling, reverse
engineering, disassembling, modifying or translating the Licensed
Materials. In no event may you alter, remove or destroy any copyright
notice included in the Licensed Materials. TI reserves all rights not
specifically granted under this Agreement.

3. Upgrades, Updates and Plug-ins - If the Licensed Materials are
labeled as an upgrade, update or plug-in you must be properly licensed
to use the product identified by TI as being eligible for such
upgrade, update or plug-in to use the Licensed Materials. An upgrade,
update, or plug-in replaces or supplements a previously licensed
eligible product. You may use the resulting upgraded product only in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and only to generate
applications for use with semiconductor devices manufactured by or for
TI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Agreement will be
construed as an obligation for TI to maintain or support the Licensed
Materials or to provide upgrades, updates or plug-ins to the Licensed
Materials.

4. Warranties and Limitations - YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND
AGREE THAT THE LICENSED MATERIALS ARE NOT INTENDED FOR
PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS AND MAY CONTAIN IRREGULARITIES
AND DEFECTS NOT FOUND IN PRODUCTION SOFTWARE.
FURTHERMORE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE
LICENSED MATERIALS HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED OR CERTIFIED BY
ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR INDUSTRY REGULATORY
ORGANIZATION OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATION. YOU
AGREE THAT PRIOR TO USING, INCORPORATING OR
DISTRIBUTING THE LICENSED MATERIALS IN ANY COMMERCIAL
PRODUCT THAT YOU WILL THOROUGHLY TEST THE PRODUCT AND
THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS IN THAT
PRODUCT AND BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR
FAILURES. THE LICENSED MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS".
TI MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
LACK OF VIRUSES, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF RESPONSES,
RESULTS AND LACK OF NEGLIGENCE. TI DISCLAIMS ANY
WARRANTY OF TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET POSSESSION,
AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY RIGHTS WITH REGARD TO THE LICENSED MATERIALS
OR YOUR USE OF THOSE MATERIALS. IN NO EVENT SHALL TI,
OR ANY APPLICABLE LICENSOR, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER
CAUSED, ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR
YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS, WHETHER OR NOT TI
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
THESE EXCLUDED DAMAGES INCLUDE, BUT ARE  NOT LIMITED
TO, COST OF REMOVAL OR REINSTALLATION, PROCUREMENT OF
SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OUTSIDE COMPUTER TIME,
LABOR COSTS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF
PROFITS, LOSS OF SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE OR INTERRUPTION
OF BUSINESS OR OTHER ECONOMIC LOSS. IN NO EVENT WILL
TI'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS
EXCEED FIVE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $500). Because
some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental
or consequential damages or limitation on how long an implied warranty
lasts, the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

5. Export Control - You hereby acknowledge and agree that unless prior
authorization is obtained from the United States Department of
Commerce, neither you nor your customers will export, re-export, or
release, directly or indirectly, any technology, software, or software
source code (as defined in Part 772 of the Export Administration
Regulations of the U.S. Department of Commerce ("FAR"), received from
TI, or export, directly or indirectly, any direct product of such
technology, software, or software source code (as defined in Part 734
of the EAR), to any destination or country to which the export,
re-export or release of the technology, software, software source
code, or direct product is prohibited by the EAR. The assurances
provided for herein are furnished to TI by you in compliance with Part
740 (Technology and Software Under Restriction) of the EAR.

6. Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Severability - This Agreement will
be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the
State of Texas, without reference to that state's conflict-of-laws
principles. This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, nor shall
it be governed by the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.
Any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement will be
brought in, and each party consents to exclusive jurisdiction and
venue in, the state and federal courts sitting in Dallas County,
Texas. Each party waives all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction
and forum non-conveniens and agrees that process may be served on
either party in a manner authorized by applicable law or court rule.
If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any
provision of the Agreement to be unenforceable, that provision will be
enforced to the maximum extent possible to effectuate the intent of
the parties and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect.

7. Entire Agreement - This is the entire Agreement between you and TI
and supercedes any prior agreement between the parties related to the
subject matter of this Agreement. No amendment or modification of this
Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by a duly
authorized representative of TI. You hereby warrant and represent that
you have obtained all authorizations and other applicable consents
required empowering you to enter into this Agreement.
