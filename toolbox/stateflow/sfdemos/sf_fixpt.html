<p>Fixed-Point Conversions</p>

<p>Stateflow allows you to include fixed-point data in your chart. This demonstration illustrates 
how you can input a value of type 'double' to a stateflow chart and output a fixed-point data 
type back to Simulink. The output data type is an 8 bit signed integer with a  slope bias of 2^-5.
This means that the maximum value of the output is 3.96875 and the minimum value is -4. 
</p>

<p>If you run the simulation, you will notice that chart output signal truncates the input signal at the
above mentioned maximum and minimum values. The Stateflow chart is simply taking the input
signal and changing the data type to fixed point. This allows you to use the Stateflow chart as
a fixed-point data converter.
