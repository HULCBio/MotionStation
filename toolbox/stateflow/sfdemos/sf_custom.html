<p>Custom C-Code Functions and Structures </p>

<p>Stateflow allows you to incorporate and to call your custom-written C-Code functions. One main
advantage of this is the ability to create and access structures directly from the Stateflow chart.
</p>

<p>In this particular demo, a C-code function defined in my_function.c and a structure that is defined
in my_header.h are included in the chart. MY_FUNCTION simply multiplies its input by 2. The
structure in my_header.h is defined as follows:
</p>

<p>typedef struct {</p>
                <p>real_T a;</p>
                <p>int8_T b[10];</p>
<p>}MyStruct;</p>
</p>

<p>In the model, we access the structure member using the dot notation:  MyStruct.a and also with
the use of a pointer: gMyStructPointerVar ->b[1]. 
</p>

<p>Notice that 'b' is defined as an 8-bit integer value and not a Real (double) value. This the reason
why 'output_c' alternates between values '1' and '0' instead of taking the precise values of the input
sine wave.
