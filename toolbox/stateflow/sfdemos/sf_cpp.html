<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Include Custom C++ Code in Stateflow</p>

<p>This demonstration shows how custom C++ files are used in a Stateflow model. You specify the name and location of the files by editing Simulation target or RTW target. </p>

<p>Open the Stateflow chart; during action of state ‘under_100’ uses adderOutput function, which exists in adder_cpp.cpp.</p>
