<p>Fixed-Point Multiplication</p>

<p>This demonstration illustrates how Fixed-Point mathematics can be used within 
your Stateflow chart. The chart takes two fixed-point inputs from Simulink: 'in1' is an
unsigned 8 bit integer with a slope bias of 2^-2 and 'in2' is an unsigned 8 bit integer
with a slope bias of 2^-3. The chart provides two outputs: 'out1' which is an unsigned 
8 bit integer with a slope bias of 2^-2 and 'out2' which is an unsigned 8 bit integer with 
a slope bias of 2^-4. 
</p>

<p>'out1' and 'out2' are calculated the same way: in1 * in2. This model demonstrates how you
obtain different results when specifiying different values for your fixed-point output. In this 
particular case, 'out2' is more accurate than 'out1' but is still a truncated result. In order to 
obtain the correct result, you need to increase the bit (or register) size of the output and also
increase the slope bias (in other words shift the radix point). For example, if you select the 
Data properties of 'out2' and change the integer size to a uint16 with a scaling value of 2^-5,
then you will receive the correct result:   13.65625
