<p>Temporal Logic using the AFTER function </p>
<p>This simple demonstration compares the difference between two Stateflow charts: one chart
uses temporal logic and the AFTER function to achieve the goal, and the other chart achieves
the same goal without using temporal logic. </p>

<p>The AFTER function allows you to easily obtain the number of events that have occurred within 
that chart and then used as a condition for an event transition. For example, in this demonstration,
a transition from the 'Off' to the 'On' state will occur after 10 events (labeled as 'secs') have passed
as long as the input, 'step', is less than 1. In this case the input 'step' is created using a Step 
function block from Simulink and the event 'secs' is defined by using a Pulse Generator. The value
 of this step will be zero until 60 seconds of simulation have gone by. After 60 seconds pass, the 
step is created and the value of the step input is 1. Since one of the transition conditions in the 
chart is not met ('step' < 1) then the transition does not take place anymore and you can notice a 
halt in the chart activity.</p>

<p>The same effect is achieved without the use of temporal logic. The difference is that an additional 
variable and transition need to be included in order to count the number of times an event takes
place. In this case, the local variable 'count_after' is used to obtain the number of times the event
'secs' occurs. The transition will then take place if 'count_after' is greater than 10 and the value of
step (which is the input) is less than 1. </p>
