<p>This demonstration shows how to model a fault-tolerant fuel system using Simulink and Stateflow.</p>

<p>The fuel rate controller subsystem contains a Stateflow chart that manages the failure state of the model based on the number of sensors that have failed.</p>

<p>To simulate sensor failure, start the simulation then double-click on any of the four Switch blocks modeling the throttle, speed, EGO, and MAP sensors.
