<p>Function Call Outputs</p>

<p>Function call outputs are used to control the activation times of other Stateflow charts or subsystems. 
This demonstration illustrates how a control Stateflow chart, named 'Source', determines the activation
times of another Stateflow chart and also function-call subsystem. The 'Function-Call Chart' is activated
after every '3' simulation time steps by the function-call signal 'out_fcn'. The 'Function-call Subsystem'
is activated every 2 time steps by receiving the function call signal named 'out_fcn_two'. 
</p>

<p>Notice that in the output plots, the time distance between each sample point is 3 for the 
'Function-Call Chart and 2 for the function-call subsystem. This is easier to view if you zoom into
the x-axis of the plots.
