<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Automatic Transmission Control</p>

<p>This demonstration shows how to model an automatic transmission system using Stateflow. The engine, vehicle, and transmission dynamics are modeled in Simulink while the shift logic is modeled using a Stateflow chart.</p>

<p>The input to the model was designated using the Signal Builder block at the far left of the diagram. Each tab on this block's dialog provides a different input profile that can be used to run the simulation.</p>
