Signal Processing Blockset Audio Files
------------------------

This file summarizes the content and specifications of audio
files shipped with the Signal Processing Blockset.  These files 
are intended for use with the "From Wave File" block or other 
applications that require an audio file as input.

Filename: speech_dft.wav
Description:
	The following phrase was spoken in a male voice:
      "The discrete Fourier transform of a real-valued signal 
       is conjugate symmetric."
	The recording sample rate was 44.1 kHz at 16 bits/sample:
		speech_dft_44100 = wavrecord(timeSpan*44100, 44100);
	The raw data was converted to a sample rate of 22.05 kHz using
	the UPFIRDN function as follows:
       speech_dft = upfirdn(speech_dft_44100, fir1(64,0.45), 1, 2);
    The data was saved to the file as follows:
    	wavwrite(speech_dft, 22050, 16, 'speech_dft.wav')
