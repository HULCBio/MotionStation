Control Design Demos</p>
<p>Simulink® Control Design provides tools for linearization of control 
systems and physical models in Simulink. Linearized Simulink models often 
simplify system analysis and compensator design. This is useful in many 
industries and applications including flight control, emissions control, and 
disk drives. </p>

<p>Simulink Control Design builds on features of the Control System Toolbox, 
such as LTI Viewer and SISO Design Tool, as well as the Simulink linearization 
engine. Use Simulink Control Design to specify input and output points without 
inserting blocks in the model, perform open loop analysis without deleting 
feedback loops, extract operating points from a simulation.  
Compute operating points from implicitly defined state and output values 
(also known as trimming) </p>
