This VI calls a Windows API dll which pops up a multiple-file select dialog box. The title input is a string and will appear at the top of the dialog box. The file type list is a two column string table containing file type pairs. Each pair consists
of what string will be displayed in the file type drop-down box on the dialog box and a string of the file extension in the form "*.*". The VI returns a list box containing the absolute paths of all files selected as strings, as well as the number of files selected.
