          <blockquote>When using DSP blocks in your Embedded Target for Motorola MPC555 model 
you may experience the problems below.  
<ul>
<p><li>
When using the WindRiver Diab compiler, many of the C files in the 
DSP library may fail to compile (depending on the version of your 
compiler). An example error message is below. It is possible to modify 
these files so that they compile with the WindRiver Diab compiler (remove 
the “const” keyword from the lines causing failures). If you are using 
the Metrowerks CodeWarrior compiler these files should compile without any 
problem.

<p><code>"d:\r13\toolbox\rtw\dspblks\c\dspburg/burg_a_c_rt.c", line 55: 
error 
(dcc:1552): initializer type `creal32_T' incompatible with object type 
`float'</code> 

<p><li>The compilation process fails providing no error message. This 
error is related to the large number of files (the DSP library) being 
compiled. The workaround is to repeat the build of the model – the DSP 
library objects created during the first build will still be present, and 
should not be re-made since the two builds are identical. This means 
that during the second build, gmake will have to compile fewer files (just 
the remaining DSP library files), which leads to a successful build.

          <blockquote>When configuring settings, Target specific options and/or Embedded Target for Motorola MPC555 real-time 
options(1) and (2), the new settings may not fully take effect.

<p>To work around this problem, you must change these settings via 
the "Launch old simprm dialog..." control.

<p>

the form:<br><br>

          <blockquote>If a regular expression contains a parenthesized subexpression which is
quantified, and the inner expression is quantified as well, for example
'(.+)+'; it can take the parser a long time to determine that a match can
not be made.  The computational complexity of this problem is exponential
with the number of characters in the string that must be tested.  In most
practical applications, it is not difficult to rewrite the inner expression
to be more specific such that each backup doesn't introduce a new set of
matches for the outer loop.

          <blockquote>On Solaris platforms, non-modal dialog boxes do not stay on top of the 
parent window. This is especially problematic when the non-modal dialog 
is completely within the MATLAB desktop area and you then click on the 
desktop or minimize MATLAB; it is difficult to find the non-modal dialog 
again. To avoid that situation, keep non-modal dialogs at least partially 
outside of the MATLAB desktop area.</blockquote>

waits for the user to enter data. However, if the Command Window is hidden
behind another window, such as a Figure window, the user might not realize
MATLAB is waiting and it appears MATLAB is hung. Bring the Command Window
forward and provide input to continue.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>When code is generated for the Look-Up Table 2-D or Look-Up Table 1-D 
block for floating-point parameters with binary search, extrapolation, and 
linear interpolation selected, the number and position of repeated zeros 
is generated explicitly into the generated code. If the breakpoint 
parameters are then tuned in the real-time code during execution and the 
number or position of repeated zeros changes, the generated code will in 
most cases get an incorrect answer when the input for that breakpoint set 
is near zero.

<p>The workaround is to avoid this problem, do not change the number or 
position of reapated zeros in breakpoint parameters for the Look-Up Table 
1-D and Look-Up Table 2-D blocks.

          <blockquote>Under <B>Compiler Options</B> on page 9-45 of the Real-Time Workshop Users Guide for Version 5, the following tip is given: "If you do not require double precision for your application, define <code>real_T</code> as float in your template make file, or you can simply specify <code>-DREAL_T=float </code> after make_rtw in the Make command field."
<P>
This documentation is not correct. Various circumstances (such as the presence of literal constants) can cause this strategy to fail to remove all doubles from the generated code. The only reliable way to be sure that doubles are absent is to formally propagate single-precision signals in the Simulink model.</blockquote>
