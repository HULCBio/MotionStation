<h2>F14 Controller Gain Editor</h2>

<p>The F14 Controller Gain Editor can be used to analyze how
changing the gains used in the Proportional-Integral Controller
affect the aircraft's angle of attack and the amount of G force
the pilot feels.</p>

<p>Note: The Simulink diagram f14.mdl must be open to run this
GUI. If you close the F14 Simulink model, the GUI will reopen it
whenever it requires the diagram to successfully execute.</p>

<h4>Changing the controller gains</h4>

<p>You can change gains in two blocks.</p>

<ol>
    <li>The Proportional gain (Kf) in the Gain block</li>
    <li>The Integral gain (Ki) in the Transfer Function block</li>
</ol>

<p>You can change either of the gains in one of the two ways.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Move the slider associated with that gain.</li>
    <li>Type a new value into the <strong>Current value</strong>
        edit field associated with that gain.</li>
</ol>

<p>The values used in the block are updated as soon as you enter
the new value in the Editor.</p>

<h4>Running the simulation</h4>

<p>Once you have set the gain values, you can run the simulation
by pressing the <strong>Simulate and store result</strong>s
button. This will simulate the F14 model using the simulation
parameters specified in the diagram's Simulation Parameters
window. The simulation time and output vectors are stored in the <strong>Results
list</strong>.</p>

<h4>Plotting results</h4>

<p>You can generate a plot of one or more results using the
following steps.</p>

<ol>
    <li>In the <strong>Results list</strong>, highlight the row
        or rows of run results that you want to plot</li>
    <li>Press the <strong>Plot</strong> button</li>
</ol>

<p>A plotting figure will be opened, if one is not already
available. Every time you press the Plot button, the old plot is
destroyed and a new one with only the selected runs is drawn.</p>

<p><strong>Removing results</strong></p>

<p>You can discard one or more of the run results using the
following steps.</p>

<ol>
    <li>In the <strong>Results list</strong>, highlight the row
        or rows of run results that you want to remove</li>
    <li>Press the <strong>Remove</strong> button</li>
</ol>
