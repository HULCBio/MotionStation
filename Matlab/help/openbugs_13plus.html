          <H3><A NAME="Backwards+Compatibility+of+Tunable+Parameters+for+Unified+Fixed+Point+Blocks"></A>Backwards Compatibility of Tunable Parameters for Unified Fixed Point Blocks</H3>
          <blockquote>Fixed Point Blocks with tunable parameters have compatibility problems
under certain conditions when loaded as Unified Blocks in Release 13.  The 
problem 
arises only if the tunable parameter is mapped to a builtin integer data 
type or to single.  There are no compatibility problems if the parameter
maps to non-builtin data type such as a scaled fixed point integer.

<p>When tunable parameters are mapped to builtin integers (or single), 
two 
types of problems may arise.  One problem is that code generated by Real 
Time Workshop in Release 13 may be less efficient than was generated in 
earlier 
releases.  The problem arises because Simulink and Fixed-Point Blockset
have different rules for mapping the data types of dialog parameters to
the data type used in online computations.  Simulink's rule requires the
data type used in the dialog be preserved in the generated code.  Fixed-
Point Blockset's rule treats the dialog parameter as providing only an
ideal real world value; no data type information is sought from the
dialog parameter even if it is tunable.

I need to put more here but have not finished.

          <blockquote>The S-function Builder block causes MATLAB to hang if the compiler options
file is not setup correctly. To avoid this problem type the following at

          <blockquote>The Simulink Scope has three modes for its "Tick Labels," which can be set
in the scope parameters dialog box.  The three settings are "all," "none",
and "Bottom Axis Only" (the default).  Using the third (default) setting
triggers a bug in which the "Time Offset" in the bottom, left corner of the
scope does not update properly.  To work around this setting, set the "Tick
Labels" to "all".</blockquote>

          <blockquote>When discretizing a model in the S domain, you cannot specify 
a sample time of 0 if the model contains a Transfer Function, 
State Space, or Zero Pole block. If you do specify a sample
time of 0, MATLAB generates an error.</blockquote>
