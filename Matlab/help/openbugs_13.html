          <blockquote>Background:
Most C-mex S-function blocks generate code via a parallel implementation
in the TLC language.  If a block does not have a TLC file, then RTW
knows a few ways to still incorporate it into the generated code, but
the result does not perform as well as if there were TLC.  The DSP
Blockset has a handful of blocks (mostly in the Linear Algebra category)
without TLC implementations.

Bug:
TLCless blocks do not work with the TI EVM Target.  The CMEX S-function
is missing from the Code Composer project.  </blockquote>

          <blockquote>Many Fixed-Point Blockset and unified blocks have an "Inherit via internal 
rule" selection for the "Output data type mode" parameter. Currently, 
these blocks may not function properly if you make this parameter 
selection while using built-in data types and without having a Fixed-Point 
Blockset license. When using the internal rule, the block may try to 
register a fixed-point data type even if you are using built-in data 
types. If you do not have a Fixed-Point Blockset license, you then get an 
error stating that you do not have the proper license, even though you are 
not using fixed-point data types.

</p>For example, suppose you try to add an <code>int8</code> to an 
<code>int16</code> and you choose the internal rule. The internal rule 
tries to check out an <code>sfix(24)</code>, which causes the model to 
error due to licensing issues. Similarly, if you multiply an 
<code>int8</code> by an <code>int32</code> and choose the internal rule, 
the output container will be an <code>sfix(40)</code>, which will cause 
the same problem.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>On Windows 98 and ME platforms, the redirection operators ">", "<" and "|" 
have limited functionality when used in DOS commands (via the 
<code>dos</code> function or the ! operator). If used with a DOS primitive 
(such as <code>dir</code> or <code>type</code>), they will function, so 
that<br><br>
<code>! dir > dir.txt</code><br><br>
works fine.<br>
<p>But if used with a <code>.exe</code> file, they will not work. For 
example,<br><br>
<code>! ping.exe -n 2 localhost > ping.txt</code><br><br>
will fail with a message from ping stating that ">" is a bad input.<br><br>

problem when you try to go to a Web page from within MATLAB.

For example, when you select an item from the <b>Web</b> menu, the selected 
page should appear in Netscape, but Netscape does not open. This might also 
happen when you run the <code>web</code> function or follow links to The 
MathWorks Web site or other URLs from the Help browser.

The problem may be due to a Netscape lock file. If Netscape has previously 
crashed, it creates a file called <code>lock</code> in the 
<code>.netscape</code> directory. To correct the problem, delete the 
<code>lock</code> file.</blockquote>

This problem will occur if an unrecogized RTDX channel is accidently

channel, a normal MATLAB error message is produced and no problems are

          <blockquote>Once a table has been added to a Tradeoff Calibration study, changing its 
properties from elsewhere, for example by changing the table size in the 
Calibration Manager, may cause an error in CAGE.  To avoid the error first 
delete the Tradeoff, then edit the table and then construct a new Tradeoff 
using the changed table.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>When you edit values in the Output column of a Normaliser table, the table 
will constrain the value you type to be displayed as an integer.  However 
it does not correctly constrain the value that is saved internally, so the 
accompanying graph is updated to show the typed value.  
Normaliser outputs should be constrained to be integers, so typing in a 
non-
integer value may lead to errors in CAGE.
The Normaliser graph, which can also be used to edit the breakpoints, 
correctly constrains the saved value to be an integer.</blockquote>
