<h2>Data Acquisition Toolbox</h2>
<p>Click on a problem listed below to read how it has been fixed in Release 12.1.</p>
<a href="#fix54">New Channel Properties</a><br>
<a href="#fix55">Daqhwinfo</a><br>
<a href="#fix56">Properties</a><br>
<a href="#fix57">Data Logging</a><br>
<a href="#fix58">Putdata</a><br>
<a href="#fix59">Adaptors - Nidaq</a><br>
<a href="#fix60">Adaptors - Hpe1432</a><br>

<a name="fix54"></a>
<h3>New Channel Properties</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Two read-only properties, NativeOffset and NativeScaling, have been added to analog input and analog output channels.  These properties can be used to convert data in native format to doubles with the formula:
    <ul>
        slope = ai.Channel(1).NativeScaling;<br>
        intercept = ai.Channel(1).NativeOffset;<br>
        data = slope*nativeData(:,1) + intercept;<br>
    </ul>
</ol>


<a name="fix55"></a>
<h3>Daqhwinfo</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>The ConversionExtraScaling and ConversionOffset fields have been removed from daqhwinfo('adaptor') where adpator is winsound, nidaq or hpe1432.  The Channel properties NativeOffset and NativeScaling should be used to convert data in native format to doubles.
<li>If an older version of the comcat.dll is on your computer, DAQHWINFO with no input arguments will not work.  However, DAQHWINFO with input arguments will work and the rest of the toolbox will work. For additional information, please refer to:
http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/v5/23852.shtml
</ol>


<a name="fix56"></a>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>When the SamplesPerTrigger property is set to a small number and the TriggerRepeat property is set to a large number, and the analog input object is started, your machine may lock up.  This will generally occur when SampleRate/SamplesPerTrigger is greater than 1000 and the TriggerRepeat property is greater than 1000.  If the analog input object's properties follow the characteristics
described above, you will receive the following warning message:
    <ul>
        Warning: Engine Block Size is small. Check SamplesPerTrigger.<br>
        Starting may lock up the machine.<br>
    </ul>
As a workaround, the SamplesPerTrigger property should be set to the number of samples you would like to acquire and TriggerRepeat should be set to 0.
</ol>


<a name="fix57"></a>
<h3>Data Logging</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>The UserData information is not returned from a .daq file.
</ol>


<a name="fix58"></a>
<h3>Putdata</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>The BitsPerSample, InputRange, SensorRange and UnitsRange properties should not be modified after calling PUTDATA.
<li>A channel cannot be added after calling PUTDATA.
</ol>


<a name="fix59"></a>
<h3>Adaptors - Nidaq</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>When running at a sampling rate of 5000 or higher and with a TransferMode value of Interrupt, there may be a considerable decline in system performance.
<li>The TriggerChannel for National Instruments 61110 and 61111 boards is always the first channel in the channel array.
<li>It is recommended that the SampleRate property is the last property set with SETVERIFY before starting since the SampleRate value is dependent upon the number of channels and the ChannelSkew property value.
<li>When using the 1200 series hardware, channels must be added in reverse order.  If invalid channels are given, the data acquisition engine will create the number of requested channels with valid hardware ids.  The hardware ids used can be determined from the object's display or from the channel's HwChannel property value.
<li>Only one digital I/O object should be pointing to the same hardware. To perform separate tasks on the hardware lines, all the necessary lines should be added to the same object and separate line groups should be created to perform the separate tasks.
<li>All channels contained within an analog input object must have all unipolar InputRange property values or all bipolar InputRange property values.  A channel array cannot contain channels with a unipolar InputRange and channels with a bipolar InputRange.
<li>When using mux boards with National Instruments, the channels must be added in a specific order.  For additional information, please refer to the online help for addmuxchannel.
<li>The PCI-1200 does not work properly with sample rates below 30-40 Hz if the TransferMode is set to SingleDMA.  If the TransferMode value is Interrupt, the PCI-1200 works properly.
</ol>


<a name="fix60"></a>
<h3>Adaptors - Hpe1432</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>For the HP E1432A and HP E1433A boards with the Arbitrary Source Output option, if an analog input object is created and started, the source will also be started.  Due to this behavior of the hardware, a TriggerType of Manual should not be used for the HP E1432A and HP E1433A hardware with the Arbitrary Source Output option.
<li>For analog output objects, it is recommended that the SampleRate or Span property is the last property set with SETVERIFY before starting since the SampleRate and Span values are dependent upon the number of channels contained in the analog output object.
<li>The first time an analog input or analog output object is connected to the HP hardware, a list of available HP hardware is determined and all the hardware is initialized.  Due to an HP limitation, this list is not updated during a MATLAB session. Therefore, if you install a new board or remove an existing board while MATLAB is
running, MATLAB will not see the new configuration and the old  configuration will still be used. To have MATLAB see the new configuration, you must restart MATLAB.
<li>Due to an HP limitation, the minimum SampleRate on the HP E1433A is 20Hz and the minimum Span on the HP E1433A is 7.8125.
<li>The first channel in the TriggerChannel property will be used to trigger the object.
<li>The HP E1434A channels 1 and 2 and channels 3 and 4 share a 56000 DSP.  Therefore, certain operational aspects will be coupled between the channels in each pair.  For example, both channels in each pair will have the same RampRate.
<li>Channels must be added in increasing order and a channel array cannot contain repeated channels.  
<li>All hardware is initialized the first time an HP object is created. When all HP objects are deleted from the data acquisition engine, all the hardware is closed.  
<li>It is recommended that if an object is created which spans multiple boards, that the object is created with the logical addresses listed in the same order in which they were found.  The DAQHWINFO command with no input arguments will list the InstalledBoardIds in the order in which the logical addresses were found.

<h2>Optimization 2.1.1 Major Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>Click on a problem listed below to read how it has been fixed in Release 12.1.</p>
<a href="#fix75">FMINCON: lower and upper bounds are respected during gradient finite-differencing.</a><br>
<a href="#fix76">LINPROG and QUADPROG: default MaxIter for medium-scale algorithms is Inf.</a><br>


<ul>
<!--92466-->
<a name="fix75"></a>
  <h3>FMINCON: lower and upper bounds are respected during gradient finite-differencing.</h3>
    <p>
    If you provide lower or upper bounds, FMINCON enforces these bounds during gradient 
    finite-differencing.
    Previously, FMINCON sometimes violated these bounds by small amounts. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <!--93709-->
<a name="fix76"></a>
  <h3>LINPROG and QUADPROG: default MaxIter for medium-scale algorithms is Inf.</h3>
    <p>
    If the 'LargeScale' option is 'off', LINPROG and QUADPROG set the default 
    MaxIter to Inf (as in versions 2.0 and earlier).  Previously, in release 
    2.1, they set the default MaxIter to be the same as the large-scale 
    algorithms. This sometimes caused a premature exit and required the user to 
    manually override the MaxIter value.

<H2>MATLAB 6.0 Major Bug Fixes</H2>
<p>Click on a problem listed below to read how it has been fixed in a previous release.</p>
<a href="#fix1">Stereo sound: recording both channels</a><br>
<a href="#fix2">Bitmaps stretched evenly when printing</a><br>
<a href="#fix3">Resize figure window using original units during printing</a><br>
<a href="#fix4">Colormaps correct when printing two or more images</a><br>

<a href="#fix10">DBLQUAD no longer accepts a trace argument</a><br>
<a href="#fix11">ODE solvers produce output at all time points specified in TSPAN.</a><br>

<ul>
<!--65023-->
<a name="fix1"></a>
<H3>Stereo sound: recording both channels</H3>

<P>Recording a stereo .wav file now works correctly. Previously, the recorded sound was
distorted (missing a channel) on playback.</P>

<!--14780-->
<a name="fix2"></a>
<H3>Bitmaps stretched evenly when printing</H3>

<P>Stretched bitmaps are now stretched evenly when printing. Previously,
one column of the stretched image would occasionally print at double width.</P>


<!--80421-->
<a name="fix3"></a>
<H3>Resize figure window using original units during printing</H3>

<P>The printing code now calls each figure's ResizeFcn (if the figure has one) with
the figure units unchanged. Previously, ResizeFcn was called after setting the
figure units to paper units.</P>

<!--58880-->
<a name="fix4"></a>
<H3>Colormaps correct when printing two or more images</H3>

<P>The color postscript driver now preserves the colors of multiple images (or axes) printed on
same page. Previously, some incorrect colors may have appeared in the output.</P>

<!--81097-->
<a name="fix5"></a>
<H3>Print to metafile at higher than screen resolution</H3>

<P>The -r (resolution) flag now allows you to specify any resolution when printing to a 
metafile. Previously, you could only print to metafiles at your screen resolution.</P>

<!--86150-->
<a name="fix6"></a>
<H3>IFFT2 uses correct scale factor for N-dimensional inputs</H3>

<P>IFFT2 now applies the correct scale factor in the case where the input has 
3 or more dimensions and the user supplies the optional mrows and mcols 
input arguments.  Previously, IFFT2's output was off by a constant scale 
factor in this case.</P>

<!--62210, 67250-->
<a name="fix7"></a>
<H3>GRIDDATA more robust</H3>

<P>GRIDDATA now uses DELAUNAYN to compute its triangles instead of DELAUNAY.
This is more robust in many cases.  Previously, GRIDDATA used to return NaNs
when used on certain cases.</P>

<!--58240, 62759-->
<a name="fix8"></a>
<H3>DELAUNAY reverts to its MATLAB 5.2 behavior</H3>

<P>A MATLAB 5.2 bug in DELAUNAY was fixed for MATLAB 5.3 but this caused different results in some cases.  In some cases, the warning "Degenerate case: collinear points. Possible incorrect triangulation."  was issued.  A modification to this bug fix returns the MATLAB 5.2 answer in MATLAB 6.0.</P>

<!--76028-->
<a name="fix9"></a>
<H3>INTERP1(X,Y,XI,'cubic') no longer calls 'spline' method on irregularly spaced data</H3>

<P>INTERP1(X,Y,XI,'cubic') now calls 'pchip' and returns cubic interpolation even when
the data is not equally spaced.  Previously, INTERP1 used to call 'spline' when the data was not equally spaced.
The old behavior is still accessible through INTERP1(X,Y,XI,'v5cubic').</P>

<!--46886-->
<a name="fix10"></a>
<H3>DBLQUAD no longer accepts a trace argument</H3>

<P>DBLQUAD used to accept a trace argument, ostensibly in order to pass it on to quad.  This was simply a placeholder and had no effect on the function, so it was removed.
</P>

<!--49923-->
<a name="fix11"></a>
<H3>ODE solvers produce output at all time points specified in TSPAN.</H3>
<P>SOLVER(ODEFUN,TSPAN,Y0) called with a vector TSPAN now evaluates
the solution at all time points specified in TSPAN. Previously, due to
rounding errors, the solution was not always evaluated at the last point of
TSPAN.</P>

<!--G#62140-->
<a name="fix12"></a>
<h3>Invisible figures cause focus changes to be slow (UNIX only)</h3>

<P>Creating invisible figure windows caused Matlab to thrash the X
server during focus changes.  This his been fixed.</p>

<!--G#58548-->
<a name="fix13"></a>
<h3>Invalid movies caused a segmentation violation</h3>

<P>Previously, calling the movie command with a movie array in which one 
or more elements were unitialized caused a segmentation violation.
This now causes an error.</p>

<!--G#67597-->
<a name="fix14"></a>
<h3>getframe sometimes fails to capture uicontrols (UNIX only)</h3>

<P>The getframe function now always captures uicontrols.</p>

<a name="fix15"></a>
<h3>getframe fails with truecolor using less than 24 bits (UNIX only)</h3>

<P>The getframe function now supports truecolor XWindows visuals using fewer
than 24 bits.</p>

<!--G#56745,56902-->
<a name="fix16"></a>
<h3>Memory leaked when converting arrays from MATLAB to Java</h3>

<p>Extensive use of the MATLAB/Java interface could result in exhaustion
of system memory.  This memory leak has been plugged.


<!--G#60477,59718,60478-->
<a name="fix17"></a>
<h3>Using CAT with cell or struct arrays may result in a crash</h3>

<p>Certain usages of CAT with cell or struct arrays or empty arrays can
result in a segmentation violation.  This regression from MATLAB 5.2 has
been corrected.


<!--G#60480-->
<a name="fix18"></a>
<h3>MATLAB may crash while reading a corrupt MAT-file</h3>

<p>It is possible to encounter a segmentation violation when reading a
corrupted MAT-file due to misplaced error check.  This problem has been
corrected.


<!--G#60479-->
<a name="fix19"></a>
<h3>Incorrect results when doing complex division in array initialization</h3> 

<p>A constant expression involving division by an imaginary number
(e.g. <TT>3/i</TT>) produced random results when used in forming an array.


<!--G#60426,61024,61595-->
<a name="fix20"></a>
<h3>Displaying structures with long field names can cause an assertion</h3>

<p>Displaying structures with long field names can cause an "Attempt to
free previously freed memory" assertion due to a flow-of-control error. 
This problem has been corrected.


<!--G58783-->
<a name="fix21"></a>
<h3>Colon indexing with sparse cell arrys can cause an assertion</h3>

<p>An expression of the form <TT>b{1} = sparse(eye(4)); b{1}(1,1)</TT>
would cause an "Attempt to free previously freed memory" assertion.  This
problem has been fixed.


<!--G#57189-->
<a name="fix22"></a>
<h3>Error occurs when using GUIDE Control Panel</h3>

<p>Opening the GUIDE Control Panel on Microsoft Windows with no open Figure
windows can cause an error under certain circumstances.  This problem has
been corrected.


<!--G#60428-->
<a name="fix23"></a>
<h3>Old P-files may cause crash when displaying cell arrays or structures</h3> 

<p>Cell array or structure expressions that display their results (i.e., are
not terminated with a semicolon) may result in a crash when run in MATLAB 5.3
if they were saved in a P-file with MATLAB 5.2 or earlier.


<!--G#61554-->
<a name="fix24"></a>
<h3>MATLAB may crash on HP systems with HP's Y2K patch (HP700 only)</h3> 

<p>A symbol name conflict between one of our third party libraries and one of
HP's system libraries can cause MATLAB to crash when creating new files.  This
issue has been resolved via an updated library.


<!--G#59094,60293-->
<a name="fix25"></a>
<h3>MATLAB may fail to start when running on IRIX 6.5 (SGI/SGI64 only)</h3>

<p>IRIX 6.5 no longer ships with certain math libraries that MATLAB depends on.
The missing libraries are now provided as part of the MATLAB distribution in
<TT>$matlab/sys/os/sgi[64]</TT>.

    or<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LINPROG(f,A,b)<br>
