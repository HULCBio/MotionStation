      <h2>Introduction<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>This demo explores general device object information and device object creation. Instrument Control Toolbox device objects
         provide a common interface for communicating with instruments using instrument drivers.
      </p>
      <p>Device objects use MATLAB instrument drivers to determine the properties and functions associated with an instrument. MATLAB
         instrument drivers also specify how to communicate with the instrument to set and get those properties, and how to execute
         the functions.
      </p>

         MATLAB instrument driver acts a wrapper around the instrument-specific commands used by the interface object.
      </p>
      <p>MATLAB VXIplug&amp;play instrument drivers use industry-standard VXIplug&amp;play drivers to communicate with instruments. The MATLAB
         instrument driver acts a wrapper around the functions in the VXIplug&amp;play driver.
      </p>
      <p>MATLAB IVI instrument drivers use industry-standard IVI-C or IVI-COM drivers to communicate with instruments. The MATLAB instrument
         driver acts a wrapper around the functions in the IVI driver.
      </p>
      <p>The Instrument Control Toolbox ships with a set of example drivers. Additional drivers can be downloaded from the File Exchange
         area on MATLAB Central.  The MAKEMID and MIDEDIT functions can be used to create new drivers and modify existing ones.
      </p>
      <h2>Creating a Device Object<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>To begin, create a device object using a MATLAB interface instrument driver.  This example uses a driver for the Tektronix
         TDS210 oscilloscope that ships with the toolbox.  The oscilloscope is connected to a Measurement Computing GPIB board having
         a board index of 0, and is located at primary address 2. First, create the interface object using the ICDEVICE function.

         drivers, you must first create a MATLAB instrument driver for the underlying VXIplug&amp;play or IVI driver.  In this example,
         MAKEMID is used to create the MATLAB instrument driver for a VXIplug&amp;play driver installed on the machine.

      </p>
      <p>Next, create a device object using the MATLAB VXIplug&amp;play instrument driver.  In this example, the instrument location is
         identified by its VISA resource name, GPIB0::2::INSTR.

%% Creating a Device Object
%
% To begin, create a device object using a MATLAB interface instrument
% driver.  This example uses a driver for the Tektronix TDS210 oscilloscope
% that ships with the toolbox.  The oscilloscope is connected to a
% Measurement Computing GPIB board having a board index of 0, and is

% the ICDEVICE function.
%
%  >> g = gpib('mcc', 0, 2);
%
% Next, create a device object that will use the interface object and the
% Tektronix TDS210 driver.

%  >> d = icdevice('tektronix_tds210.mdd', g)

%    Instrument Information
%       Type:               Oscilloscope
%       Manufacturer:       Tektronix
%       Model:              TDS210
%  
%    Driver Information
%       DriverType:         MATLAB interface object
%       DriverName:         tektronix_tds210.mdd
%       DriverVersion:      1.0
%  
%    Communication State
%       Status:             closed
%
% You may also use industry-standard drivers, such as VXIplug&play and IVI
% drivers, with device objects.  To use one of these drivers, you must
% first create a MATLAB instrument driver for the underlying VXIplug&play
% or IVI driver.  In this example, MAKEMID is used to create the MATLAB
% instrument driver for a VXIplug&play driver installed on the machine.
%
%  >> makemid('tktds5k', 'tktds5k_matlab_driver');
%
% The above command will create a new MATLAB VXIplug&play instrument
% driver, tktds5k_matlab_driver.mdd in the current directory, using the
% functions found in the VXIplug&play driver, tktds5k.
%
% Next, create a device object using the MATLAB VXIplug&play instrument
% driver.  In this example, the instrument location is identified by its VISA
% resource name, GPIB0::2::INSTR.

%% Cleanup
% When you are finished with the device object, disconnect it from the
% instrument, remove it from memory, and remove it from the workspace.
