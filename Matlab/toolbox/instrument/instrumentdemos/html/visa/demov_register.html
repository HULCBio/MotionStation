      <h2>Introduction<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>This demo explores register-based read and write operations for VISA-VXI and VISA-GPIB-VXI objects.</p>
      <p>The information obtained for this demonstration was prerecorded. Therefore, you do not need an actual instrument to learn
         about register-based functions.
      </p>
      <p>The instrument used was a Hewlett-Packard (HP) E1432A 16-Channel 51.2 kSa/s Digitizer plus DSP Module.</p>
      <p>The examples given throughout this tutorial use a VISA-VXI object. However, you can also use a VISA-GPIB-VXI object. Refer
         to the command-line help on the VISA function to see how to create a VISA-GPIB-VXI object.
      </p>
      <p>VXI instruments are either message-based or register-based. Generally, it is assumed that the message-based instruments are
         easier to use while the register-based instruments are faster.
      </p>
      <p>A message-based instrument has its own processor that allows it to interpret high-level commands such as a SCPI command. Therefore,
         to communicate with a message-based instrument, you can use the ASCII or binary read and write functions (FSCANF, FREAD, FPRINTF,
         FWRITE,...). If the message-based instrument also contains shared memory, you can access the shared memory through register-based
         read and write operations.
      </p>
      <p>A register-based instrument usually does not have its own processor to interpret high-level commands. Therefore, to communicate
         with a register-based instrument, you need to use read and write functions that access the registers.
      </p>
      <p>All VXI instruments have an A16 memory space consisting of 64 bytes. It is known as an A16 space because the addresses are
         16 bits wide. Register-based instruments provide a memory map of the address space that includes details about the information
         contained within the A16 space. For example, the HP E1432A instrument contains the following information:
      </p><pre>  Offset              Information
  ------              -----------
  0                   ID Register
  2                   Device Type Register
  4                   Status Register
  6                   Offset Register</pre><p>Some VXI instruments also have an A24 or A32 space if the 64 bytes provided by the A16 space are not enough to perform the
         necessary tasks. A VXI instrument cannot use both the A24 and A32 space.
      </p>
      <h2>Functions and Properties<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>These functions are used to perform register-based read and write operations:</p><pre> MEMMAP           - Map memory for low-level memory
                    read and write.
 MEMPEEK          - Low-level memory read of instrument
                    register.
 MEMPOKE          - Low-level memory write of instrument
                    register.
 MEMREAD          - High-level memory read of instrument
                    register.
 MEMUNMAP         - Unmap memory for low-level memory
                    read and write.
 MEMWRITE         - High-level memory write to instrument
                    register.</pre><p>These properties are associated with register-based read and write operations:</p><pre> MappedMemoryBase - The base address of the mapped memory
 MappedMemorySize - The size of the mapped memory
 MemoryBase       - Indicate the base address of the A24
                    or A32 space
 MemoryIncrement  - Indicate whether the VXI registers are
                    read from or written to as block or FIFO
 MemorySize       - Indicate the size of the A24 or A32
                    space
 MemorySpace      - Indicate the type of memory space the
                    instrument supports</pre><h2>Creating a VISA Object<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>To begin, create a VISA-VXI object. The HP E1432A VXI instrument is in the first chassis and has a logical address of 8.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; v = visa('agilent', 'VXI0::8::INSTR');</pre><pre>  VISA-VXI Object Using AGILENT Adaptor : VISA-VXI0-8</pre><pre>  Communication Address
     ChassisIndex:       0
     LogicalAddress:     8</pre><pre>  Communication State
     Status:             closed
     RecordStatus:       off</pre><pre>  Read/Write State
     TransferStatus:     idle
     BytesAvailable:     0
     ValuesReceived:     0
     ValuesSent:         0</pre><h2>Connecting the VISA Object to Your Instrument<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>Before you can perform a read or write operation, you must connect the VISA-VXI object to the instrument with the FOPEN function.
         If the VISA-VXI object was successfully connected, its Status property is automatically configured to open.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; fopen(v)
&gt;&gt; get(v, 'Status')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>open</pre><h2>Register Characteristics<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <h2>Register Characteristic Properties -- MemorySpace<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>The MemorySpace property indicates the type of memory space the instrument supports. By default, all instruments support A16
         memory space. However, this property can be A16/A24 or A16/A32 if the instrument also supports A24 or A32 memory space, respectively.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(v, 'MemorySpace')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>A16/A24</pre><p>Note that the VXI object must be connected to the instrument before the MemorySpace property is queried, otherwise the default
         value of A16 is returned.
      </p>
      <h2>Register Characteristic Properties -- MemoryBase and MemorySize<a name="7"></a></h2>
      <p>The MemoryBase property indicates the base address of the A24 or A32 space, and is defined as a hexadecimal string. The MemorySize
         property indicates the size of the A24 or A32 space. If the VXI instrument supports only the A16 memory space, MemoryBase
         defaults to '0H%' and MemorySize defaults to 0.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(v, {'MemoryBase', 'MemorySize'})</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>   '200000H'    [262144]</pre><h2>High-Level Memory Read and Write Operations<a name="8"></a></h2>
      <p>The Instrument Control toolbox provides both high-level and low-level memory functions. High-level memory functions allow
         you to access memory through simple function calls. Unlike low-level memory  functions, high-level memory functions do not
         require that memory be mapped to a window. The memory mapping is  handled automatically for you by the functions. As a result,
         the high-level memory functions are easier to use but are slower than the low-level memory functions. The high-level functions
         also allow you to read or write multiple registers at once.
      </p>
      <h2>High-Level Memory Read<a name="9"></a></h2>
      <p>Before you perform a read or write operation, you should understand the information stored by your instrument's registers.
         The HP E1432A documentation states that the first 16-bit register, the ID Register, provides information about the instrument's
         configuration. It is always defined as CFFF:
      </p><pre>      Bits     Value     Description
      ====     =====     ===========
      15-14    11        indicating that the instrument
                         is register-based
      13-12    00        indicating that the instrument
                         supports the A24 memory space
      11-0     all 1's   HP's ID</pre><p>MEMREAD allows you to read uint8, uint16, uint32, or single values from the specified memory space with the specified offset.
         For example, read the first 16-bit register (offset is 0) as a uint16.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; data = memread(v, 0, 'uint16', 'A16')</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>     53247</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; dec2hex(data)</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>CFFF</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; dec2bin(53247)</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>1100111111111111</pre><h2>High-Level Memory Read -- Reading a Block of Data<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>It is also possible to read a block of data with the MEMREAD function. For example, read the instrument's ID Register and
         Device Type Register.
      </p>
      <p>The ID Register was read in the previous example and should have a value of CFFF. The Device Type Register is the next register
         and is defined as follows:
      </p><pre>    Bits               Contents
    ----               --------
    15-12              required A24 memory
    11-0               Model Code - should be 201H</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; data = memread(v, 0, 'uint16', 'A16', 2)</pre><pre>data =</pre><pre>     53247
     20993</pre><h2>High-Level Memory Write<a name="11"></a></h2>
      <p>The MEMWRITE function allows you to write uint8, uint16, uint32, or single values to the specified memory space with the specified
         offset.
      </p>
      <p>Write a value to the Offset Register, which is at offset 6 in the A16 space. The Offset Register defines the base address
         of the device's A24 registers. Note that this value should be restored to it's original values if you want to access the A24
         registers.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; original_Value = memread(v, 6, 'uint16', 'A16');
&gt;&gt; memwrite(v, 40960, 6, 'uint16', 'A16');
&gt;&gt; memread(v, 6, 'uint16', 'A16')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>   40960</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; memwrite(v, original_Value, 'uint16', 'A16');</pre><h2>Low-Level Memory Read and Write Operations<a name="12"></a></h2>
      <p>The low-level memory functions are faster than the high-level memory functions but require you to map the memory to be read
         or written. The low-level memory functions  allow you to read and write one register at a time.  Additionally, to increase
         speed, the low-level memory  functions do not report back any errors that may have  occurred.
      </p>
      <h2>Mapping the Memory Space<a name="13"></a></h2>
      <p>To begin using the low-level memory routines, you must first map your memory space with the MEMMAP function.</p>
      <p>Note that if the memory requested by the MEMMAP function does not exist, an error is returned.</p>
      <p>In this example, map the first 16 registers of the A16 memory space:</p><pre>&gt;&gt; memmap(v, 'A16', 0, 16);</pre><h2>Low-Level Memory Properties -- MappedMemoryBase and MappedMemorySize<a name="14"></a></h2>
      <p>The VISA-VXI object has two properties that indicate if memory has been mapped: MappedMemoryBase and MappedMemorySize. These
         properties are similar to the MemoryBase and MemorySize properties that describe the A24 or A32 memory space. The MappedMemoryBase
         property is the base address of the mapped memory and is defined as a hexadecimal string. The MappedMemorySize property is
         the size of the mapped memory.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; get(v, {'MappedMemoryBase', 'MappedMemorySize'})</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>   '16737610H'    [16]</pre><h2>Low-Level Memory Read<a name="15"></a></h2>
      <p>The MEMPEEK function allows you to read uint8, uint16, uint32, or single values from the specified offset in the mapped memory
         space.
      </p>
      <p>For example, read the information in the ID Register. This is the first register in the A16 space:</p><pre>&gt;&gt; mempeek(v, 0, 'uint16')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>      53247</pre><p>Now read the information in the Device Type Register. This register also provides information on the instrument's configuration.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; mempeek(v, 2, 'uint16')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>      20993</pre><h2>Low-Level Memory Write<a name="16"></a></h2>
      <p>The MEMPOKE function allows you to write uint8, uint16, uint32, or single values to the specified offset in the mapped memory
         space.
      </p>
      <p>For example, write a value to the Offset Register and verify that the value was written by reading the Offset Register's new
         value.
      </p><pre>&gt;&gt; original_Value = mempeek(v, 6, 'uint16');
&gt;&gt; mempoke(v, 45056, 6, 'uint16');
&gt;&gt; mempeek(v, 6, 'uint16')</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>    45056</pre><pre>&gt;&gt; mempoke(v, original_Value, 6, 'uint16');</pre><h2>Unmapping the Memory Space<a name="17"></a></h2>
      <p>Once you have finished reading the registers or writing to the registers, you should unmap the memory with the MEMUNMAP function.</p><pre>&gt;&gt; memunmap(v)
&gt;&gt; get(v, {'MappedMemoryBase', 'MappedMemorySize'})</pre><pre>ans =</pre><pre>   '0H'    [0]</pre><p>Note that if memory is still mapped when the object is disconnected from the instrument, the memory is automatically unmapped
         for you.
      </p>
      <h2>Cleanup<a name="18"></a></h2>
      <p>If you are finished with the VISA-VXI object, disconnect it from the instrument, remove it from memory, and remove it from
         the workspace.

%% Introduction
% This demo explores register-based read and write operations
% for VISA-VXI and VISA-GPIB-VXI objects.  
% 
% The information obtained for this demonstration was prerecorded. 
% Therefore, you do not need an actual instrument 
% to learn about register-based functions. 
% 
% The instrument used was a Hewlett-Packard (HP) E1432A 16-Channel 
% 51.2 kSa/s Digitizer plus DSP Module.
% 
% The examples given throughout this tutorial use a VISA-VXI
% object. However, you can also use a VISA-GPIB-VXI object.
% Refer to the command-line help on the VISA function to see
% how to create a VISA-GPIB-VXI object.
%
% VXI instruments are either message-based or register-based. 
% Generally, it is assumed that the message-based instruments 
% are easier to use while the register-based instruments are 
% faster.
% 
% A message-based instrument has its own processor that allows 
% it to interpret high-level commands such as a SCPI command. 
% Therefore, to communicate with a message-based instrument, 
% you can use the ASCII or binary read and write functions
% (FSCANF, FREAD, FPRINTF, FWRITE,...). If the message-based 
% instrument also contains shared memory, you can access 
% the shared memory through register-based read and write 
% operations.
% 
% A register-based instrument usually does not have its own 
% processor to interpret high-level commands. Therefore, to
% communicate with a register-based instrument, you need to 
% use read and write functions that access the registers.  
%
% All VXI instruments have an A16 memory space consisting of 
% 64 bytes. It is known as an A16 space because the addresses 
% are 16 bits wide. Register-based instruments provide a  
% memory map of the address space that includes details about
% the information contained within the A16 space. For example,
% the HP E1432A instrument contains the following information:
% 
%    Offset              Information
%    REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH              REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-
%    0                   ID Register
%    2                   Device Type Register
%    4                   Status Register
%    6                   Offset Register
% 
% Some VXI instruments also have an A24 or A32 space if the 
% 64 bytes provided by the A16 space are not enough to perform
% the necessary tasks. A VXI instrument cannot use both the 
% A24 and A32 space. 

%% Functions and Properties
% These functions are used to perform register-based read
% and write operations:
% 
%   MEMMAP           - Map memory for low-level memory  
%                      read and write.
%   MEMPEEK          - Low-level memory read of instrument 
%                      register.
%   MEMPOKE          - Low-level memory write of instrument 
%                      register.
%   MEMREAD          - High-level memory read of instrument 
%                      register.
%   MEMUNMAP         - Unmap memory for low-level memory 
%                      read and write.
%   MEMWRITE         - High-level memory write to instrument
%                      register.
% 
% These properties are associated with register-based read 
% and write operations:
% 
%   MappedMemoryBase - The base address of the mapped memory
%   MappedMemorySize - The size of the mapped memory
%   MemoryBase       - Indicate the base address of the A24 
%                      or A32 space
%   MemoryIncrement  - Indicate whether the VXI registers are 
%                      read from or written to as block or FIFO
%   MemorySize       - Indicate the size of the A24 or A32 
%                      space
%   MemorySpace      - Indicate the type of memory space the
%                      instrument supports

%% Creating a VISA Object
% To begin, create a VISA-VXI object. The HP E1432A VXI
% instrument is in the first chassis and has a logical address 
% of 8.  
% 
%  >> v = visa('agilent', 'VXI0::8::INSTR');
% 
%    VISA-VXI Object Using AGILENT Adaptor : VISA-VXI0-8
% 
%    Communication Address 
%       ChassisIndex:       0
%       LogicalAddress:     8
% 
%    Communication State 
%       Status:             closed
%       RecordStatus:       off
% 
%    Read/Write State  
%       TransferStatus:     idle
%       BytesAvailable:     0
%       ValuesReceived:     0
%       ValuesSent:         0
% 

%% Connecting the VISA Object to Your Instrument
% Before you can perform a read or write operation, you must
% connect the VISA-VXI object to the instrument with the 
% FOPEN function. If the VISA-VXI object was successfully
% connected, its Status property is automatically configured
% to open.
% 
%  >> fopen(v)
%  >> get(v, 'Status')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%  open 

%% Register Characteristics
%% Register Characteristic Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH MemorySpace
% The MemorySpace property indicates the type of memory space
% the instrument supports. By default, all instruments support 
% A16 memory space. However, this property can be A16/A24 or
% A16/A32 if the instrument also supports A24 or A32 memory
% space, respectively.
% 
%  >> get(v, 'MemorySpace')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%  A16/A24
% 
% Note that the VXI object must be connected to the instrument

%% Register Characteristic Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH MemoryBase and MemorySize
% The MemoryBase property indicates the base address of the

%% High-Level Memory Read and Write Operations
% The Instrument Control toolbox provides both high-level and low-level
% memory functions. High-level memory functions allow you to access memory 
% through simple function calls. Unlike low-level memory  functions,
% high-level memory functions do not require that memory be mapped to a
% window. The memory mapping is  handled automatically for you by the
% functions. As a result, the high-level memory functions are easier to use
% but are slower than the low-level memory functions. The high-level
% functions also allow you to read or write multiple registers at once.
%

%% High-Level Memory Read
% Before you perform a read or write operation, you should
% understand the information stored by your instrument's
% registers. The HP E1432A documentation states that the
% first 16-bit register, the ID Register, provides information 
% about the instrument's configuration. It is always defined 
% as CFFF:
% 
%        Bits     Value     Description
%        ====     =====     ===========
%        15-14    11        indicating that the instrument 
%                           is register-based
%        13-12    00        indicating that the instrument 
%                           supports the A24 memory space
%        11-0     all 1's   HP's ID
% 
% MEMREAD allows you to read uint8, uint16, uint32, or single
% values from the specified memory space with the specified 
% offset. For example, read the first 16-bit register
% (offset is 0) as a uint16.
% 
%  >> data = memread(v, 0, 'uint16', 'A16')
% 
%  data =
% 
%       53247
% 
%  >> dec2hex(data)
% 
%  ans =
% 
%  CFFF
% 
%  >> dec2bin(53247)
% 
%  ans =
% 
%  1100111111111111

%% High-Level Memory Read REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH Reading a Block of Data
% It is also possible to read a block of data with the
% MEMREAD function. For example, read the instrument's
% ID Register and Device Type Register.
% 
% The ID Register was read in the previous example and
% should have a value of CFFF. The Device Type Register
% is the next register and is defined as follows:
% 
%      Bits               Contents
%      REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH               REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH
%      15-12              required A24 memory
%      11-0               Model Code - should be 201H
% 
%  >> data = memread(v, 0, 'uint16', 'A16', 2)
% 
%  data =
% 
%       53247
%       20993 

%% High-Level Memory Write
% The MEMWRITE function allows you to write uint8, uint16, 
% uint32, or single values to the specified memory space with 
% the specified offset. 
% 
% Write a value to the Offset Register, which is at 
% offset 6 in the A16 space. The Offset Register defines the
% base address of the device's A24 registers. Note that 
% this value should be restored to it's original values if 
% you want to access the A24 registers.
% 
%  >> original_Value = memread(v, 6, 'uint16', 'A16');
%  >> memwrite(v, 40960, 6, 'uint16', 'A16');
%  >> memread(v, 6, 'uint16', 'A16')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%     40960
% 
%  >> memwrite(v, original_Value, 'uint16', 'A16');

%% Low-Level Memory Read and Write Operations
% The low-level memory functions are faster than the high-level memory
% functions but require you to map the memory to be read or written. The
% low-level memory functions  allow you to read and write one register at a
% time.  Additionally, to increase speed, the low-level memory  functions
% do not report back any errors that may have  occurred.

%% Mapping the Memory Space
% To begin using the low-level memory routines, you must 
% first map your memory space with the MEMMAP function.  
% 
% Note that if the memory requested by the MEMMAP function
% does not exist, an error is returned.  
% 
% In this example, map the first 16 registers of the 
% A16 memory space:
% 
%  >> memmap(v, 'A16', 0, 16);

%% Low-Level Memory Properties REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH MappedMemoryBase and MappedMemorySize
% The VISA-VXI object has two properties that indicate if
% memory has been mapped: MappedMemoryBase and MappedMemorySize.
% These properties are similar to the MemoryBase and MemorySize
% properties that describe the A24 or A32 memory space. The
% MappedMemoryBase property is the base address of the mapped
% memory and is defined as a hexadecimal string. The 
% MappedMemorySize property is the size of the mapped memory.  
% 
%  >> get(v, {'MappedMemoryBase', 'MappedMemorySize'})
% 
%  ans = 
% 
%     '16737610H'    [16]

%% Low-Level Memory Read
% The MEMPEEK function allows you to read uint8, uint16, uint32, 
% or single values from the specified offset in the mapped 
% memory space. 
% 
% For example, read the information in the ID Register.
% This is the first register in the A16 space:
% 
%  >> mempeek(v, 0, 'uint16')
%  
%  ans =
% 
%        53247
% 
% Now read the information in the Device Type Register.
% This register also provides information on the instrument's
% configuration. 
% 
%  >> mempeek(v, 2, 'uint16')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%        20993

%% Low-Level Memory Write 
% The MEMPOKE function allows you to write uint8, uint16,  
% uint32, or single values to the specified offset in the 
% mapped memory space. 
% 
% For example, write a value to the Offset Register 
% and verify that the value was written by reading the Offset
% Register's new value.
% 
%  >> original_Value = mempeek(v, 6, 'uint16');
%  >> mempoke(v, 45056, 6, 'uint16');
%  >> mempeek(v, 6, 'uint16')
% 
%  ans =
% 
%      45056
% 
%  >> mempoke(v, original_Value, 6, 'uint16');

%% Unmapping the Memory Space
% Once you have finished reading the registers or writing 
% to the registers, you should unmap the memory with the
% MEMUNMAP function.
% 
%  >> memunmap(v)
%  >> get(v, {'MappedMemoryBase', 'MappedMemorySize'})
% 
%  ans = 
% 
%     '0H'    [0]
% 
% Note that if memory is still mapped when the object is 
% disconnected from the instrument, the memory is automatically
% unmapped for you.

%% Cleanup
% If you are finished with the VISA-VXI object, disconnect
% it from the instrument, remove it from memory, and remove it 
% from the workspace.
% 
%  >> fclose(v);
%  >> delete(v);
%  >> clear v
