function varargout = fgets(obj)
%FGETS Read one line of text from instrument, keep terminator.
%
%   TLINE=FGETS(OBJ) reads one line of text from the instrument
%   connected to interface object, OBJ and returns to TLINE. The 
%   returned data does include the terminator with the text line.
%   To exclude the terminator, use FGETL.
%    
%   For serial port, VISA-serial and TCPIP objects, FGETS blocks 
%   until one of the following occurs:
%       1. The terminator is received as specified by the Terminator 
%          property
%       2. A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property
%       3. The input buffer is filled 
%
%   For GPIB, VISA-GPIB, VISA-VXI, VISA-GPIB-VXI, VISA-TCPIP, VISA-USB
%   and VISA-RSIB objects, FGETS blocks until one of the following occurs:
%       1. The EOI line is asserted 
%       2. The terminator is received as specified by the EOSCharCode
%          property (if defined). This option is not available for 
%          VISA-RSIB objects.
%       3. A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property
%       4. The input buffer is filled 
%
%   For UDP objects, FGETS blocks until one of the following occurs:
%       1. The terminator is received as specified by the terminator
%          property (if DatagramTerminateMode is off).
%       2. A datagram has been received (if DatagramTerminateMode is on).
%       3. A timeout occurs as specified by the Timeout property.
%
%   The interface object, OBJ, must be connected to the instrument with  
%   the FOPEN function before any data can be read from the instrument 
%   otherwise an error is returned. A connected interface object has 
%   a Status property value of open. 
%
%   For GPIB, VISA-GPIB, VISA-VXI, VISA-GPIB-VXI, VISA-TCPIP and VISA-USB
%   objects, the terminator is defined by setting OBJ's EOSMode property to
%   read or read&write and setting OBJ's EOSCharCode property to the ASCII
%   code for the character received. For example, if the EOSMode property
%   is set to read and the EOSCharCode property is set to LF, then one of
%   the ways that the read terminates is when the linefeed character 
%   is received. A terminator cannot be defined for VISA-RSIB objects.
%
%   [TLINE,COUNT]=FGETS(OBJ) returns the number of values read to COUNT.
%   COUNT includes the terminator.
%
%   [TLINE,COUNT,MSG]=FGETS(OBJ) returns a message, MSG, if FGETS did
%   not complete successfully. If MSG is not specified a warning is 
%   displayed to the command line. 
%
%   [TLINE,COUNT,MSG,DATAGRAMADDRESS]=FGETS(OBJ) returns the datagram
%   address to DATAGRAMADDRESS, if OBJ is a UDP object. If more than
%   one datagram is read, DATAGRAMADDRESS is ''.
%
%   [TLINE,COUNT,MSG,DATAGRAMADDRESS,DATAGRAMPORT]=FGETS(OBJ) returns
%   the datagram port to DATAGRAMPORT, if OBJ is a UDP object. If more
%   than one datagram is read, DATAGRAMPORT is [].
%
%   OBJ's ValuesReceived property will be updated by the number of values
%   read from the instrument including the terminator.
%
%   If OBJ's RecordStatus property is configured to on with the RECORD
%   function, the data received, TLINE, will be recorded in the file
%   specified by OBJ's RecordName property value.
% 
%   Examples:
%       g = visa('agilent', 'GPIB0::2::0::INSTR');
%       fopen(g)
%       fprintf(g, '*IDN?');
%       idn = fgets(g);
%       fclose(g);
