You can type <b><a run="commgui">commgui</a></b> to open the graphical user
interface (GUI) example. This example provides a simple tool for you to 
compute bit-error-rates using different combinations of different
methods. This help file briefly describes how to use the tool.

<TITLE>Communication Toolbox GUI Example General Information</TITLE>
<A NAME="general">
<p><h2>General Information</h2>
The graphical user interface (GUI) example illustrates how to
use the Communications Toolbox to compute the bit-error-rate.
The example uses MATLAB functions in sources and sinks,
error-control coding, modulation, and channel categories.

The computation is based on the parameters provided in the data
entry slot. In the GUI window, all white areas are designed for
data input.

<p>You can define your own computation by choosing <b>my own</b> in the 
GUI window. To be able to run your algorithm, you need to
edit the file <b>commod.m</b>.

<TITLE>Load/Save Window Parameters for Comm Toolbox GUI Example </TITLE>
<A NAME="loadsave">
<p><H2>Load/Save Window Parameters</h2>
The <b>File</b> menu at the top of the GUI window enables you to load and 
save the parameters defined in this example. The saved data includes the 
parameters of the computation methods, the resulting computation data, and 
the curve fitting order. The file <b>commfoo.mat</b> in the <b>comm</b> 
directory of the Communications Toolbox is an example of the saved data.  
<p>

The <b>Load setup</b> and <b>Save setup</b> selections in the <b>File</b> 
menu uses a browser file system to help 
you access your directory (folder) and files.

<TITLE>Define Computation Parameters in the Communications Toolbox GUI Example</TITLE>
<A NAME="parameter">
<p><H2>Define Computation Parameters</h2>
The GUI window is divided into two sections: the upper section
for parameter entries and the lower section for displaying the computed data.
The computation goes through the stages of 

<dl>
<dd>Source Data
<dd>Error Control Coding
<dd>Modulation
<dd>Channel
<dd>Demodulation
<dd>Error Control Decoding
<dd>Save Data
</dl>

The first parameter in the channel category can be a vector. The vector 
length determines the computed data length. When you use the 
random integers in the Source category, the data length can be a 
scalar or a vector. The vector length must match the length of the
first parameter in the channel. When you use a
workspace variable as an input source, the workspace variable
can be a column vector, or a matrix with its column number the same
length as the first parameter in the Channel category.

<p>You can view the help for the functions <b><A HREF="encode.m">encode</A></b>
and <b><A HREF="decode.m">decode</A></b> to find the definition of the
error-control coding parameters.

<p>You can view the help for the functions <b><A HREF="amod.m">dmod</A></b>
and <b><A HREF="ademod.m">ddemod</A></b> for the passband modulation/demodulation
simulation parameters.
You can view the help for the functions <b><A HREF="amodce.m">dmodce</A></b>
and <b><A HREF="ademodce.m">ddmodce</A></b> for the baseband modulation/demodulation
simulation parameters.<p>

If you don't know how to choose a parameter, leave the parameter entry
empty. The example will fill in a default parameter for you.

<TITLE>Start Computation in the Communications Toolbox GUI Example</TITLE>
<A NAME="computation">
<p><H2>Start Computation</h2>
After defining the parameters, you can click the <b>Run</b> button 
to start the simulation. There are two indicators that appear between the 
upper and lower sections of the GUI wich show the 
computation stages. A textual indicator in the center shows 
which computation category is being processed. The categories are:

<dl>
<dd>Source Data
<dd>Error Control Coding
<dd>Modulation
<dd>Channel
<dd>Demodulation
<dd>Error Control Decoding
<dd>Save Data
</dl>

There is also a status bar that runs across the width of the GUI and shows 
the percentage of the computation completed. The percentage is the ratio of
the completed computation stages to the total number of computation stages.

<p> The computed data is stored in the Current Data storage area. The data
contains SNR, the signal to noise ratio, and bit_err_ratio, the
bit error ratio.

<TITLE>Managing Computation Data in the Communications Toolbox GUI Example</TITLE>
<A NAME="data">
<p><H2>Manage Computation Data</h2>
The GUI window provides one sub-window for the storage of your current running 
result and four sub-windows for the storage of your data comparison. You can move 
the data to any one of these sub-windows by simply dragging from others. You can 
also import the data from Matlab workspace variables. You can also export the data 
to Matlab workspace variables.

<p>To get the plot for error rate estimation, choose the curve fit order and 
press <b>PLOT</b> button. It will compute the data that you have in the sub-window by the 
current curve fit order and plot the results in a new window. To see the comparison,
just select any one of the sub-windows you need and it will only plot the selected 
data.
 
<p>Note that after you have dropped the data into the trash can,
the data will be deleted from the window. There is no
undo.
