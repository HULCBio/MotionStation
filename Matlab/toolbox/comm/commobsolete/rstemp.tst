This is a test file for Reed-Solomon code. In this
example, the original file is coded with Reed-Solomon code    
with N=127 and K=117. Assume there is some error  
in the storage or the transformation. The file should be      
recovered in the R-S decoding process. The begin- 
ning of the coded file is the redundancy symbols added by     
the coding process, which are used in the recovery process.   
This example uses functions RSENCOF and RSDECOF.--end.
