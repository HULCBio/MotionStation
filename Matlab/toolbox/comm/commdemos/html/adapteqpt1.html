      <h1>Adaptive Equalizer Simulation (Part I)</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>This script simulates a communication link with PSK modulation, raised-cosine pulse shaping, multipath fading, and adaptive
            equalization.
         </p>
         <p>It is the first of two parts:  Part I (adapteqpt1.m) sets simulation parameters and creates channel and equalizer objects.
            Part II (adapteqpt2.m) performs a link simulation based on these settings, which are stored in the MATLAB workspace.  For
            information on the Part II script, enter demo('toolbox','comm') at the MATLAB prompt, and select "Adaptive Equalizer Simulation
            (Part II)".
         </p>
         <p>Part I sets up three equalization scenarios, and calls Part II multiple times for each of these.  Each call corresponds to
            a transmission block. The pulse shaping and multipath fading channel retain state information from one block to the next.
             For visualizing the impact of channel fading on adaptive equalizer convergence, the simulation resets the equalizer state
            every block.
         </p>
         <p>To experiment with different simulation settings, you can edit the Part I script.  For instance, you can set the ResetBeforeFiltering
            property of the equalizer object to 0, which will cause the equalizer to retain state from one block to the next.
         </p>

      <p>Create structures containing information about the transmit and receive filters (txFilt and rxFilt).  Each filter has a square-root

      </p>
      <p>The transmit and receive filters incorporate upsampling and downsampling, respectively, and both use an efficient polyphase
         scheme (see Part II script for more information).  These multirate filters retain state from one transmission block to the
         next, like the channel object (see "Simulation 1: Frequency-flat fading channel" below).
      </p>
      <p>The peak value of the impulse response of the filter cascade is 1.  The transmit filter uses a scale factor to ensure unit
         transmitted power.
      </p>
      <p>To construct the pulse filter structures, this script uses an auxiliary function adapteq_buildfilter.m.  An improved approach
         would be to use multirate filter objects from the Filter Design Toolbox.
