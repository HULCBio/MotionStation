      <h2>Getting the right parameters.<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>Finding the right parameters in a fixed-point C program can be difficult.  But not today.</p>
      <h2>M algorithm<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>Suppose we have the following simple algorithm in M.  It computes the running average of its input x using a weighting vector
         b, which has been given to us.
      </p>
      <p>Note that the output y, is also used as an input parameter so that y can be aware of its data type.</p><pre>function [y,z] = fi_m_fir(b, x, z, y)
for k=1:length(x);
  z = [x(k);z(1:end-1)];
  y(k) = b*z;
end</pre><h2>C algorithm<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>We have translated the M function into this C function, and we need to figure out a number of things.  How do we scale the
         integer inputs b, x, and z so they retain maximum precision?  Will there be overflow when we run data through it?  We are
         using native integer data types, but what if I have, say, 12-bit data?  Which bits of the 16 are the 12-bits of data stored
         in?  How do I compute the values of accOneHalfLSB and accShift that are used to round the 32-bit accumulator and shift into
         the 16-bit output?
      </p><pre>void fi_c_fir(int16_T *b, int16_T *x, int16_T *z, int16_T *y,
                       int    nb, int    nx, int    nz,
            int32_T accOneHalfLSB, int accShift)
{
    int32_T acc;
    int k;
    int i;
    for (k=0; k&lt;nx; k++) {
        memmove(z+1,z,sizeof(int16_T)*nz);
        z[0] = x[k];
        acc = 0;
        for (i=0; i&lt;nb; i++) {
            acc += (int32_T)b[i] * (int32_T)z[i];
        }
        y[k] = (acc  + accOneHalfLSB) &gt;&gt; accShift;
    }
}</pre><h2>Today is your lucky day.<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>The answer to all of the above questions is:  Define the word lengths of the variables and let fi worry about everything else.</p>
      <h2>First, try the algorithm in floating-point M<a name="5"></a></h2><pre class="codeinput">b = fi_fir_coefficients; <span class="comment">% Vector b is given to us.</span>
rand(<span class="string">'state'</span>,0);
N = 20;
x = 2*rand(N,1)-1;
z = zeros(length(b),1);
y = zeros(size(x));
</pre><h2>Run the M-file with floating-point parameters.<a name="6"></a></h2><pre class="codeinput">yfl = fi_m_fir(b, x, z, y);
</pre><h2>Define the word lengths<a name="7"></a></h2>
      <p>The attributes of our fixed-point parameters have been set up in this example so that we can set the word lengths and let
         fi figure out the best scaling for the fraction lengths (binary points) in the data, in the product register, in the sum register
         (accumulator), and there is even a convenient function to compute the numeric type of the output of this algorithm that will
         retain best precision in the output and at the same time guarantee that no overflows occur.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, we can always go in and fully specify all these scaling parameters ourselves, but then every time we changed any
         word length, we would have to go through and adjust all the other parameters too.
      </p>
      <p>It is hard to overstate how much work this saves us.  If we want to change the simulation to use 12-bit coefficients and 8-bit
         data, we just need to change those word lengths.  If the data is given to us as integers, or as floating-point values, the
         best scaling is used to store the data, and then the scaling of all related computations are changed automatically.
      </p>
      <p>In the following, we are saying "effective word length" because when we get to the C program, the data are stored in 16-bit
         integers, and the product and sum are stored in 32-bit integers.  However, the M-file fixed-point algorithm will use the effective
         word lengths as specified for any value from 2 to 65535 bits.  The C algorithm will act as though those are the actual word
         lengths from 2 to 16- and 32-bits, respectively. This is very convenient for simulating fixed-point algorithms on your desk
         top computer that will run on an embedded device with word lengths different than the standard 8, 16, and 32 bits.

%% Fixed-Point C Development 
% This demo shows how to use the parameters from a fixed-point MATLAB program in a
% fixed-point C program.

%% Getting the right parameters.
%
% Finding the right parameters in a fixed-point C program can be
% difficult.  But not today.

%% M algorithm
%
% Suppose we have the following simple algorithm in M.  It computes the
% running average of its input x using a weighting vector b, which has
% been given to us.
%
% Note that the output y, is also used as an input parameter so that y
% can be aware of its data type.
%
%  function [y,z] = fi_m_fir(b, x, z, y)
%  for k=1:length(x);
%    z = [x(k);z(1:end-1)];
%    y(k) = b*z;
%  end

%% C algorithm
%
% We have translated the M function into this C function, and we need to
% figure out a number of things.  How do we scale the integer inputs b,
% x, and z so they retain maximum precision?  Will there be overflow
% when we run data through it?  We are using native integer data types,
% but what if I have, say, 12-bit data?  Which bits of the 16 are the
% 12-bits of data stored in?  How do I compute the values of
% accOneHalfLSB and accShift that are used to round the 32-bit
% accumulator and shift into the 16-bit output?
%
%  void fi_c_fir(int16_T *b, int16_T *x, int16_T *z, int16_T *y, 
%                         int    nb, int    nx, int    nz,
%              int32_T accOneHalfLSB, int accShift)
%  { 
%      int32_T acc;
%      int k;
%      int i;
%      for (k=0; k<nx; k++) {
%          memmove(z+1,z,sizeof(int16_T)*nz);
%          z[0] = x[k];
%          acc = 0;
%          for (i=0; i<nb; i++) {
%              acc += (int32_T)b[i] * (int32_T)z[i];
%          }
%          y[k] = (acc  + accOneHalfLSB) >> accShift;
%      }
%  }

%% Today is your lucky day.  
% The answer to all of the above questions is:  Define the word lengths
% of the variables and let fi worry about everything else.

%% First, try the algorithm in floating-point M
b = fi_fir_coefficients; % Vector b is given to us.
rand('state',0);
N = 20;
x = 2*rand(N,1)-1;
z = zeros(length(b),1);
y = zeros(size(x));

%% Run the M-file with floating-point parameters.
yfl = fi_m_fir(b, x, z, y);

%% Define the word lengths
%
% The attributes of our fixed-point parameters have been set up in this
% example so that we can set the word lengths and let fi figure out the
% best scaling for the fraction lengths (binary points) in the data, in the
% product register, in the sum register (accumulator), and there is even a
% convenient function to compute the numeric type of the output of this
% algorithm that will retain best precision in the output and at the same
% time guarantee that no overflows occur.
%
% Of course, we can always go in and fully specify all these scaling
% parameters ourselves, but then every time we changed any word length, we
% would have to go through and adjust all the other parameters too.
%
% It is hard to overstate how much work this saves us.  If we want to
% change the simulation to use 12-bit coefficients and 8-bit data, we just
% need to change those word lengths.  If the data is given to us as
% integers, or as floating-point values, the best scaling is used to store
% the data, and then the scaling of all related computations are changed
% automatically.
%
% In the following, we are saying "effective word length" because when we
% get to the C program, the data are stored in 16-bit integers, and the
% product and sum are stored in 32-bit integers.  However, the M-file
% fixed-point algorithm will use the effective word lengths as specified
% for any value from 2 to 65535 bits.  The C algorithm will act as though
% those are the actual word lengths from 2 to 16- and 32-bits, respectively.
% This is very convenient for simulating fixed-point algorithms on your
% desk top computer that will run on an embedded device with word lengths
% different than the standard 8, 16, and 32 bits.
Wb    = 16; % Effective word length of the coefficients, b
Wx    = 12; % Effective word length of the data, x
Wy    = 16; % Effective word length of the output, y
Wprod = 32; % Effective word length of the product (int32_T)b[i] * (int32_T)z[i]
Wacc  = 32; % Effective word length of the sum stored in int32_T acc

%% Configure the fixed-point math parameters
% We configure so that the products and sums are aligned
% in the least-significant bits, and the overflow mode is wrap, as it
% would is in C.
F = fimath('ProductMode','KeepLSB', 'ProductWordLength',Wprod,...
           'SumMode','KeepLSB', 'SumWordLength',Wacc,...
           'OverFlowMode','wrap');

%% Define the fixed-point variables
bfi = fi(b, 1, Wb, 'fimath', F);
xfi = fi(x, 1, Wx, 'fimath', F);
zfi = fi(z, numerictype(xfi), 'fimath',F);

%% Compute the fraction length of the output
%
% Compute the number of integer bits necessary for no overflow in the
% inner product b*z. Then leave that much head room in y.  
y_fractionlength = Wy - innerprodintbits(bfi,zfi);
yfi = fi(y, 1, Wy, y_fractionlength, 'fimath', F);

%% Run the same M-file. This time it's fixed-point because the inputs are.
yfi = fi_m_fir(bfi, xfi, zfi, yfi);

%% Plot the floating-point and fixed-point side by side
% Note that the lines in the plot overlay each other.  If you are running
% this program, and have stopped at this point, you can zoom in on the
% graph and see that the values are slightly different.
t = 0:length(y)-1;
plot(t,yfl,t,yfi);set(gcf,'color',[1 1 1]);
legend('Floating-point','Fixed-point')
xlabel('t (samples)')

%% Plot the error
%
% Plot the error and compare with the scaling of the least-significant
% bit of the fixed-point value centered around the mean of the error.
err = double(yfi) - yfl;
m   = mean(err);
delta = double(lsb(yfi));
tlim  = [0 t(end)];
plot(t,err,tlim,[m m],tlim,m-delta*[1 1],'r',tlim,m+delta*[1 1],'r')
set(gcf,'color',[1 1 1]);
legend('Error','Mean of the error','1 LSB about the mean')
xlabel('t (samples)')


%% Define integer parameters to pass to C.
% Our C program is expecting 16-bit signed integers, so we cast to that specific type. 
bint = int16(bfi);
xint = int16(xfi);
zint = int16(zfi);

%% Let fi tell us the numeric type of the inner-product
%
% In particular, we need to know where the binary point is so that we
% will know what part of the accumulator to pluck the output data from.
acc = bfi*zfi

%% Run the fixed-point C filter
yint = fi_c_fir(bint, xint, zint, acc.fractionlength, y_fractionlength);

%% Compare fi to fixed-point C. It is bit faithful!
[int16(yfi) yint int16(yfi)-yint]

%% Something useful
% 
% Now that we're fairly confident that our C program is doing the right
% thing, let's do something useful with it.
%
% Load a sound file and listen to it.  Also see if the Signal Processing
% Toolbox is available so we can analyze these signals later.
isSignalToolboxAvailable = license('test','Signal_Toolbox');
load mtlb
x = mtlb;
n = length(x);
t = (0:n-1)'/Fs;
soundsc(x,Fs)

%% Plot the sound over time
plot(t,x)
set(gcf,'color',[1 1 1]);
xlabel('t (sec)')
title('Original sound')
%% Spectrogram of the sound
if isSignalToolboxAvailable
  specgram(x,512,Fs);
  set(gcf,'color',[1 1 1]);
  title('Original sound')
end

%% Quantize and listen.
xfi = fi(x,1,Wx);
soundsc(double(xfi),Fs)

%% Frequency response of the moving-average algorithm
% Let's take a look at the frequency response of the moving average filter
% defined by vector b.  Notice that there is a null in the frequency
% response at about 2140 Hz.  This means that any sound at 2140 Hz will be
% averaged out if it is run through the moving-average algorithm.  The 2140
% Hz frequency is relative to the sampling frequency, Fs, that was used
% when the sound was recorded.
if isSignalToolboxAvailable
  freqz(b,1,1024,Fs);
  set(gcf,'color',[1 1 1]);
end
%% Add noise
% Since my algorithm will filter out any signal at 2140 Hz, let's add
% a sinusoid at that frequency to the original signal and see if we can
% filter it out with our fixed-point moving-average algorithm written in C.
N = length(x);
noise = sin(2*pi*2140*(0:n-1)'./Fs);
xnoisy = x + noise;

%% Quantize the noisy sound and listen
xfi = fi(xnoisy,1,Wx);
soundsc(double(xfi),Fs);

%% Plot the sound over time
plot(t,xfi)
set(gcf,'color',[1 1 1]);
xlabel('t (sec)')
title('Quantized, noisy sound')
%% Spectrogram of the sound.  Notice the dark line at 2140 Hz.
if isSignalToolboxAvailable
  specgram(double(xfi),512,Fs);
  set(gcf,'color',[1 1 1]);
  title('Quantized, noisy sound')
end

%% Set up the fixed-point parameters as before
zfi = fi(z, numerictype(xfi), 'fimath',F);
acc = bfi*zfi;
y_fractionlength = Wy - innerprodintbits(bfi,zfi);

%% Filter in C with the same parameters as before and listen
% Can you still hear the noise signal?  Can you tell any other differences
% in the sound?
xint = int16(xfi);
yint = fi_c_fir(bint, xint, zint, acc.fractionlength, y_fractionlength);

soundsc(double(yint),Fs)

%% Plot the original and the filtered signals together
% If you are running this demo and have paused at this section, zoom in on
% the plot.  Can you see the high frequency noise in the original signal?
% Can you see that it has been smoothed out in the filtered signal?  
%
% Notice that the filtered signal has been delayed in
% time.  Can you tell by how much?  How is the time delay in samples
% related to the length of b?
%
% The signals are scaled to make them easier to compare.  
xscaled = double(xint); xscaled = xscaled/max(abs(xscaled));
yscaled = double(yint); yscaled = yscaled/max(abs(yscaled));
plot(t,[xscaled yscaled])
set(gcf,'color',[1 1 1]);
legend('Noisy','Filtered')
xlabel('t (sec)')
title('Filtered sound')
%% Spectrogram of the sound.   Notice the dark line at 2140 Hz is gone.
if isSignalToolboxAvailable
  specgram(double(yint),512,Fs);
  set(gcf,'color',[1 1 1]);
  title('Filtered sound')
end


%% Take it for a spin!
% Open this demo in the MATLAB editor by typing
%  
%   edit fi_c_developmentdemo.m
%
% from the MATLAB command line.
%
% Then, go back up to the top and modify the word length parameters and
% step through the code using "cell mode" in the editor.
%
% Try these values:
%
%   Wb    =  8; % Effective word length of the coefficients, b
%   Wx    =  8; % Effective word length of the data, x
%   Wy    =  8; % Effective word length of the output, y
%   Wprod = 32; % Effective word length of the product (int32_T)b[i] * (int32_T)z[i]
%   Wacc  = 32; % Effective word length of the sum stored in int32_T acc
%
% What was the error like?  What did it sound like?

%% Examine the C file
%
% The C file is located in the same directory as the M-file.  You can
% open it by typing
%
%   edit fi_c_fir.c
%
% from the MATLAB command line.  If you have MATLAB configured for a C
% compiler, you can compile this file by typing
%
%   mex fi_c_fir.c
%
% from the MATLAB command line.  For more information on compiling mex
% files, type
%
%   help mex
%   doc mex
%
% from the MATLAB command line.

%% Modify a copy of the C algorithm
%
% The implementation of the algorithm in C that we are using in this
% demo was done for clarity: it's structure is very much like the
% algorithm in M.   Can you modify the C algorithm so that it runs faster?
