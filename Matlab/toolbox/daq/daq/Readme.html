<h3>New Channel Properties</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Two read-only properties, NativeOffset and NativeScaling, have been added to analog input and analog output channels.  These properties can be used to convert data in native format to doubles with the formula:
    <ul>
        slope = ai.Channel(1).NativeScaling;<br>
        intercept = ai.Channel(1).NativeOffset;<br>
        data = slope*nativeData(:,1) + intercept;<br>
    </ul>
</ol>


<h3>Daqhwinfo</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>The ConversionExtraScaling and ConversionOffset fields have been removed from daqhwinfo('adaptor') where adpator is winsound, nidaq or hpe1432.  The Channel properties NativeOffset and NativeScaling should be used to convert data in native format to doubles.
<li>If an older version of the comcat.dll is on your computer, DAQHWINFO with no input arguments will not work.  However, DAQHWINFO with input arguments will work and the rest of the toolbox will work. For additional information, please refer to:

</ol>


<h3>Properties</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>When the SamplesPerTrigger property is set to a small number and the TriggerRepeat property is set to a large number, and the analog input object is started, your machine may lock up.  This will generally occur when SampleRate/SamplesPerTrigger is greater than 1000 and the TriggerRepeat property is greater than 1000.  If the analog input object's properties follow the characteristics
described above, you will receive the following warning message:
    <ul>
        Warning: Engine Block Size is small. Check SamplesPerTrigger.<br>
        Starting may lock up the machine.<br>
    </ul>
As a workaround, the SamplesPerTrigger property should be set to the number of samples you would like to acquire and TriggerRepeat should be set to 0.
</ol>


<h3>Data Logging</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>The UserData information is not returned from a .daq file.
</ol>


<h3>Putdata</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>The BitsPerSample, InputRange, SensorRange and UnitsRange properties should not be modified after calling PUTDATA.
<li>A channel cannot be added after calling PUTDATA.
</ol>


<h3>Adaptors - Nidaq</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>When running at a sampling rate of 5000 or higher and with a TransferMode value of Interrupt, there may be a considerable decline in system performance.
<li>The TriggerChannel for National Instruments 61110 and 61111 boards is always the first channel in the channel array.
<li>It is recommended that the SampleRate property is the last property set with SETVERIFY before starting since the SampleRate value is dependent upon the number of channels and the ChannelSkew property value.
<li>When using the 1200 series hardware, channels must be added in reverse order.  If invalid channels are given, the data acquisition engine will create the number of requested channels with valid hardware ids.  The hardware ids used can be determined from the object's display or from the channel's HwChannel property value.
<li>Only one digital I/O object should be pointing to the same hardware. To perform separate tasks on the hardware lines, all the necessary lines should be added to the same object and separate line groups should be created to perform the separate tasks.
<li>All channels contained within an analog input object must have all unipolar InputRange property values or all bipolar InputRange property values.  A channel array cannot contain channels with a unipolar InputRange and channels with a bipolar InputRange.
<li>When using mux boards with National Instruments, the channels must be added in a specific order.  For additional information, please refer to the online help for addmuxchannel.
<li>The PCI-1200 does not work properly with sample rates below 30-40 Hz if the TransferMode is set to SingleDMA.  If the TransferMode value is Interrupt, the PCI-1200 works properly.
</ol>


<h3>Adaptors - Hpe1432</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>For the HP E1432A and HP E1433A boards with the Arbitrary Source Output option, if an analog input object is created and started, the source will also be started.  Due to this behavior of the hardware, a TriggerType of Manual should not be used for the HP E1432A and HP E1433A hardware with the Arbitrary Source Output option.
<li>For analog output objects, it is recommended that the SampleRate or Span property is the last property set with SETVERIFY before starting since the SampleRate and Span values are dependent upon the number of channels contained in the analog output object.
<li>The first time an analog input or analog output object is connected to the HP hardware, a list of available HP hardware is determined and all the hardware is initialized.  Due to an HP limitation, this list is not updated during a MATLAB session. Therefore, if you install a new board or remove an existing board while MATLAB is
running, MATLAB will not see the new configuration and the old  configuration will still be used. To have MATLAB see the new configuration, you must restart MATLAB.
<li>Due to an HP limitation, the minimum SampleRate on the HP E1433A is 20Hz and the minimum Span on the HP E1433A is 7.8125.
<li>The first channel in the TriggerChannel property will be used to trigger the object.
<li>The HP E1434A channels 1 and 2 and channels 3 and 4 share a 56000 DSP.  Therefore, certain operational aspects will be coupled between the channels in each pair.  For example, both channels in each pair will have the same RampRate.
<li>Channels must be added in increasing order and a channel array cannot contain repeated channels.  
<li>All hardware is initialized the first time an HP object is created. When all HP objects are deleted from the data acquisition engine, all the hardware is closed.  
<li>It is recommended that if an object is created which spans multiple boards, that the object is created with the logical addresses listed in the same order in which they were found.  The DAQHWINFO command with no input arguments will list the InstalledBoardIds in the order in which the logical addresses were found.
