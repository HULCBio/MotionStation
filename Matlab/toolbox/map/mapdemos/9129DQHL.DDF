Source photography is typically from National Aerial Photography Program or National High Altitude Photography Program.  30-minute DEM's may be derived or resampled from level 1 7.5-minute DEM's.00108 D     00041   22 400010200DQHL65024DQHL5SOURCE DATE OF PUBLISHED MAP OR PHOTOGRAPHY:  Unspecified00069 D     00041   22 400010200DQHL26025DQHL6INSPECTION FLAG:  00173 D     00045   33 40001002000DQHL1260026DQHL7DATA VALIDATION FLAG: 1; RMSE computed from test points, no quantitative test, no interactive DEM editing or review.  00103 D     00041   22 400010200DQHL60027DQHL8GRID RESOLUTION: 30.000000 meters X 30.000000 meters01258 D     00049   44 4000100020000DQHL120700028DQHL9GENERAL NOTES: A number of factors affect gridding processes and the accuracy of the final DEM product:  1)  A dependency exists between the scale of the source materials and the level of detail or grid refinement that is possible from a given source.   2) During the process of changing scale, from large to small, some source data may be generalized or dropped out and, therefore, some features would not be available for formation of, or incorporation into, a grid at that scale.  3)  The process of forming a grid with regular spacing requires the transfer of precise point or vector data to generalized grid square corners using a process similar to taking a simple weighted average.  This process may alter the apparent position upon display of point or vector source data, reducing the ability to recover positions of specific features whose dimensions are less than the internal grid cell spacing.   For all DEM's, the grid spacing and spatial resolution results in data intervals that span terrain discontinuities, such as benches, tops, and drainage.  Some features can be appropriately captured at a given grid spacing while other, smaller features are subdued or filtered out altogether.01329 D     00049   44 4000100020000DQHL127800029DQHL10VISUAL VERIFICATION:  Because of practical limitations inherent in all collection systems there will always be some artifacts such as benches, striations, patches, or some other anomaly that imparts some signature of the collection system in the data set.  Some of these artifacts, although falling within normal DEM vertical error tolerances, can coalesce with valid surface features. All DEM's are viewed and edited so corrective actions can be taken to minimize these artifacts. For example,  1) Isolated tops are depicted with their approximate size and shape; 2) Flat trending surfaces are depicted as generally flat trending without confusing patterns or striations; and,  3) Water bodies are flat, lower than the surrounding terrain, and have shorelines clearly delineated.   Additional testing is performed using a DEM Editing System (DES) to aid in the identification of blunders such as irregularly gridded data, mistagging of tops and depressions, and spikes.  These blunders are generally identified by displaying the DEM with the aid of DES options, which include color banding of elevation gradients, stereoscopic viewing using anaglyphic filters, and shaded-relief enhancement.  An elevation matrix is analyzed in suspect areas and corrected as required.00343 D     00045   33 40001003000DQHL29500310DQHL11The free form header text from the DEM has been automatically included without being reviewed or enhanced.
