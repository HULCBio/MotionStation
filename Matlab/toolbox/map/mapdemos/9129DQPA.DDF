A vertical RMSE of 7 meters or less is the desired accuracy standard.  A RMSE of 15 meters is the maximum permitted.  A 7.5-minute DEM at Level 1 has an absolute elevation error tolerance of 50 meters (approximately three times the 15-meter RMSE) for blunders for any grid node when compared to the true elevation.  Any array of points in the DEM can not encompass more than 49 contiguous elevations in error by more than 21 meters (three times the 7-meter RMSE).  Systematic errors within the stated accuracy standards are tolerated in level 1 DEM's.00313 D     00045   33 40001002000DQPA2660021DQPA2ACCURACY: RMSE of the file's datum relative to the absolute datum (x,y,z) is (0, 0, 0); accuracy is estimated, not computed.  RMSE of the DEM data relative to the file's datum (x,y,z) is (0, 0, 7); accuracy has been calculated based on a sample size of 20.  00082 D     00041   22 400010200DQPA39022DQPA3CONTOUR INTERVAL:  Unspecified.00084 D     00041   22 400010200DQPA41023DQPA4SUSPECT AREAS:No suspect areas.  00297 D     00045   33 40001002000DQPA2500024DQPA5VERTICAL DATUM SHIFT: -0.070000.  Adding this value to the elevation values will convert it to North American Vertical Datum 1988.  Value is computed by averaging the shift values for the four quadrangle corners obtained from program VERTCON.01190 D     00049   44 4000100020000DQPA113900025DQPA6SUSPECT AREAS: Suspect areas in the DEM result from corresponding areas on the graphic source that are shown as symbolized by contours that have been overprinted with photorevised or other surface patterns. Examples of disturbed surfaces are: lava flows, land slides, open pit mining, construction cut and fill, and land fill operations. An estimated elevation is supplied for suspect areas based on the presumed elevation at the time the DEM grid is generated; however, the true elevation is subject to change without notice. When an elevation cannot be estimated for a suspect area, the area is downgraded to a void area and assigned a false negative value -32,767. Grid posts falling in suspect areas are added to the DEM grid as though they were valid elevations; they are distinguishable from normal DEM grid posts only by an independent inspection of the graphic source. For this reason, no percentage value for the total number of cells in the DEM that are assigned an estimated value. Suspect areas relate only to graphic sources. Furthermore, no commensurate code exists for suspects areas in the DLG hypsography category.00295 D     00045   33 40001002000DQPA2480026DQPA7WATER BODIES:  Water body areas are naturally occurring areas of constant elevation.  Oceans or estuaries at mean sea level are assigned an elevation value of zero.  All other water bodies are assigned their known or an estimated elevation.00585 D     00045   33 40001002000DQPA5380027DQPA8HORIZONTAL ACCURACY:  The horizontal positions of grid posts in USGS DEM's are located at precise mathematically defined positions in UTM meters or arc seconds.  These grid posts are fixed in position and can be considered constants for the purpose of determining accuracy.  The only measurable or perceivable errors in the DEM exist as vertical errors that may be partially attributable to horizontal error inherent in the source data or to errors in converting horizontal and vertical components of the source to gridded format.
