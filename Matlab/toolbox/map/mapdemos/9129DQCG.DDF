Hence, the scans do not always have the same number of elevation posts due to the variable angle between true north and grid north of the UTM coordinate system. Any elevation post that falls outside of the 7.5-minute quadrangle edge is dropped, i.e. there is no overedge. The 7.5-minute DEM will be encoded as a non-ragged grid by filling with a background post value to the edges of the minimum bounding rectangle.   The fill value is distinguishable from all other elevation post values, and it will be same value for all USGS DEM series encoded in SDTS. The Void post value(-32767) will not be reused as the fill value, so the original extent of the DEM data can easily be detected.00469 D     00045   33 40001002000DQCG4220022DQCG3Void areas occur in the DEM as a result of interruptions to the contours of the source graphic or DLG (eg. photoimages overprinted onto a topographic map). Each DEM elevation post located within a void area is assigned a false negative value of -32,767. The percentage of void elevation values in the DEM, if present, was calculated from the total number of grid posts in the DEM assigned the false negative value.01227 D     00049   44 4000100020000DQCG117600023DQCG4HYDROGRAPHY  INCLUDED: For DEM Level 1 and 2, water bodies contained in DEM data are edited when they conform to the following criteria: 1) Type is a pond, lake, reservoir, or double-line drainage; and, 2) Size of a pond, lake or reservoir  exceeds approximately 1/2 inch at map scale (1000 feet at 1:24,000 scale, 4167 feet at 1:100,000 scale) along the major axis; or, 3) Size of a double-line drain exceeds 1/4 inch (500 feet at 1:24,000 scale, 2087 feet at 1:100,000 scale) in width. For level 3 DEM's, the grid is constrained by all major hydrographic features contained within a DLG hydrography category, including drainage, lakes, swamps, and shorelines. Elevations of hydrographic features are determined through interpolation of contours using a registered DLG hypsography file. DEM surfaces constrained to drains are treated as a special case of hypsographic faulting where the DEM surface is simply creased along the track line of the drain. Additionally, all grid cells are tilted consistent with the direction of stream flow, along the track line of the drain. There must not be any unsupported breaks or discontinuities in the rate of slope of the drain.
