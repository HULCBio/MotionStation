  Data set construction
  ---------------------
  This data set was constructed by concatenating Massachusetts Highway
  Department road shapefiles for the Maynard and Concord USGS Quadrangles,
  from compressed files mrd97.exe and mrd104.exe.
 
  Features were selected with bounding boxes intersecting the following
  box:
            [206500 (min easting)  910500 (min northing)
             211500 (max easting)  913500 (max northing)]
 
  The following attributes were retained:
 
      'STREETNAME', 'RT_NUMBER', 'CLASS', 'ADMIN_TYPE', 'LENGTH'
 
  Attributes 'CLASS' and 'ADMIN_TYPE' contain numerical codes defined by
  MassGIS as follows:
 
  Road classes (from file mrdac.dbf)

  CLASS 1 Limited access highway
  CLASS 2 Multi-lane highway, not limited access
