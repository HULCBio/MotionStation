The Europoean Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) maintains a comprehensive
database of geodetic parameters that has become a defacto standard for
managing datums and projected coordinate systems in a wide range of
geospatial applications. For more information on the EPSG and their
Geodesy Parameters database, see http://www.epsg.org

EPSG Database Tables in CSV Format
==================================
This directory contains a collection of tables from the EPSG Geodesy
Parameters database, version 6.2.2.  The tables were converted to CSV
(comma separated value) by the libgeotiff open source project. These
files came with the libgeotiff version 1.2.0 source distribution in the
libgeotiff-1.2.0/csv directory.

According to the libgeotiff distribution notes, these are "true"
CSV files.  Quotes within quoted strings are doubled to escape them,
rather than using backslash quoting.  Newlines may appear within quoted
field values (as real raw newline characters).  All table names were
converted to lower case, and spaces replaced with underscores to make
them more easily worked with. 

In addition to the EPSG tables dumped to CSV, the following additional
items from the libgeotiff distribution are included in this directory:

 pcs.csv: An attempt to collect most information about a PCS, including
          the projection parameters into one fast access file. 

 gcs.csv: An attempt to collect most information about a GCS, including
          the WGS84 shift parameters (if there is only one path in EPSG).

 projop_wparm.csv: Projection operations with projection parameters.  
          Essentially the coordinate_operation.csv table with the
          parameters from coordinate_operation_parameter_values.csv
          appended to each  record.
 
EPSG Conditions of Use
======================
The EPSG web site stipulates the following in regard to the use of the
data:

      1. All data pertinent to a specific coordinate system must be copied 
        without modification and all related pages/records must be included; 

      2. All components of this data set pertinent to any given coordinate 
        system must be distributed together (complete distribution of all 
        components of the data set is preferred, but the EPSG recognises 
        the need for a more limited distribution); 

      3. The data may not be distributed for profit by any third party; and
 
      4. The original source [EPSG] must be acknowledged.

      The user assumes the entire risk as to the accuracy and the use of
      this data. The data may be copied and distributed subject to the
      following  conditions:
