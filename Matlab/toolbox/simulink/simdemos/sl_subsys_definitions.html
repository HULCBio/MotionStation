<h1>Simulink Subsystem Definitions</h1>

<p>
Subsystems are the means by which you can group blocks together in your model
to manage model complexity. Simulink consists of two classes of subsystems:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Virtual subsystems</b> provide graphical hierarchy in models.
   Virtual subsystems do not impact execution. During model execution, the
   Simulink engine flattens all virtual subsystems, i.e., Simulink expands
   the subsystem in place before execution. This expansion is very similar
   to the way macros work in a programming language such as C or C++.</p></li>

<li><b>Nonvirtual subsystems</b> provide execution and graphical hierarchy in
   models. Nonvirtual subsystems are executed as a single unit (atomic
   execution) by the Simulink engine. The blocks within a nonvirtual subsystem
   execute only when all subsystems inputs are valid. All nonvirtual subsystems
   are drawn with a bold border. Simulink defines the following nonvirtual
   subsystems:
   </p>
   <ul>

   <li><b>Atomic Subsystems</b>.  The main difference between a virtual
   subsystem and an atomic subsystem is that blocks in an atomic subsystem
   execute as a single unit. This gives the advantage of componentizing
   functional aspects of models at the execution level. Any Simulink block can
   be placed in an atomic subsystem including blocks with different execution
   rates. You create an atomic subsystem by selecting the <code>Treat as atomic
   unit</code> option on a virtual subsystem.</p></li>

   <li><b>Enabled subsystems</b>. An Enabled Subsystem behaves similarly to an
   atomic subsystem, except that it executes only when the signal driving the
   subsystem's enable port is greater than zero. You can also configure an
   enabled subsystem to hold or reset the states of blocks within the enabled
   subsystem via the <code>States when enabling</code> parameter in the enable
   port block.  Each output port of an enabled subsystem can be configured to
   hold or reset its output via the <code>Output when disabled</code> parameter
   in the outport block. You create an enabled subsystem by placing an enable
   port block within a subsystem. </p></li>

   <li><b>Triggered subsystems</b>. A trigger subsystem executes when a rising
   or falling edge with respect to zero is seen on the signal driving the
   subsystem trigger port. The direction of the triggering edge is defined by
   the <code>Trigger type</code> parameter on the trigger port block. Simulink
   limits the type of blocks placed in a triggered subsystem to blocks that do
   not have explicit sample times (i.e., blocks within the subsystem must have a
   sample time of -1) because the contents of a triggered subsystem
   execute in an aperiodic fashion. You create a triggered subsystem by placing
   a trigger port block within a subsystem. A Stateflow chart can also have a
   trigger port which is defined by using the Stateflow editor. From Simulink's
   perspective there is no difference between a triggered subsystem and a
   triggered chart.</p></li>

   <li><b>Function-call subsystems</b>. A function-call subsystem is analogous
   to a function written in a textual language such as M except that the
   statements of the function are realized using Simulink blocks. You use a
   Stateflow chart, a function-call generator, or an S-function to perform a
   function-call that executes a function-call subsystem. Simulink limits the
   types of blocks placed in a function-call subsystem to blocks that do not
   have explicit sample times (i.e., blocks within the subsystem must have a
   sample time of -1) because the contents of a function-call subsystem execute
   in an aperiodic fashion. Specifically, a function-call initiator can execute
   a function-call subsystem zero or more times. Function-call subsystems are
   created by placing a trigger port block with the <code>Trigger type</code>
   parameter set to function-call within a subsystem. A Stateflow chart can
   also have a function-call port, which is defined by using the Stateflow
   editor.</p></li>

   <li><b>Enabled with trigger subsystems</b>. An enabled with trigger subsystem
   is essentially a triggered subsystem that executes when the subsystem is
   enabled and a rising or falling edge with respect to zero is seen on
   the signal driving the subsystem trigger port. The direction of the
   triggering edge is defined by the <code>Trigger type</code> parameter on the
   trigger port block. Simulink limits the types of blocks placed in an
   enabled with triggered subsystem to blocks that do not have explicit sample
   times (i.e., blocks within the subsystem must have a sample time of -1)
   because the contents of a triggered subsystem execute in an aperiodic
   fashion. You create an enabled with triggered subsystem by placing a
   trigger port block and a enable port block within a subsystem.<p></li>

   <li><b>Action subsystems</b>. Action subsystems can be thought of as an
   intersection of the properties of enabled subsystems and function-call
   subsystems. Action subsystems are restricted to have one sample time (e.g., a
   continuous, discrete, or inherited sample time). Action subsystems must be
   executed by an action subsystem initiator. This is either an If block or a
   SwitchCase block. All action subsystems connected to a given action subsystem
   initiator must have the same sample time. An action subsystem is created by
   placing an action port block within a subsystem. The subsystem icon will
   automatically adapt to the type of block (i.e., If or SwitchCase block) that
   is executing the action subsystem.
   <p>
  
   <p>
   Action subsystems can be executed at most once by the action subsystem
   initiator. Action subsystems give you control over when the states reset via
   the <code>States when execution is resumed</code> parameter on the action
   port block. Action subsystems also give you control over whether or not to
   hold the outport values via the <code>Output when disabled</code> parameter
   on the outport block. This is analogous to enabled subsystems.
   </p>

   <p>
   Action subsystems behave very similarly to function-call subsystems because
   they must be executed by an initiator block. <em>Function-call subsystems can
   be executed more than once on any given time step whereas action subsystems
   can be executed at most once</em>. This restriction means that a larger set
   of blocks (e.g., periodic blocks) can be placed in action subsystems when
   compared with function-call subsystems. This restriction also means that you
   can have control over how the states and outputs behave.
   </p>
   </p></li>

   <li><b>While-subsystems</b>. A while-subsystem will run multiple iterations
   on each model time step. The number of iterations is controlled by the
   while-iterator block condition. A while-subsystem is created by placing a
   while-iterator block within a subsystem block.
   <p>

   A while-subsystem is very similar to a function-call subsystem in that it can
   run for any number of iterations on a given time step. The while-subsystem
   differs from a function-call subsystem in that there is no separate initiator
   (e.g., a Stateflow Chart). In addition, a while-subsystem has access to the
   current iteration number optionally produced by the while-iterator block. A
   while-subsystem also gives you control over whether or not to reset states
   when starting via the <code>States when starting</code> parameter on the
   while-iterator block.  </p></li>
 
   <li><b>For-subsystems</b>.  A for-subsystem will run a fixed number of
   iterations on each model time step. The number of iterations can be an
   external input to the for-subsystem or specified internally on the
   for-iterator block. A for-subsystem is created by placing a for-iterator
   block within a subsystem block.
   <p>
  
   A for-subsystem has access to the current iteration number that is
   optionally produced by the for-iterator block. A for-subsystem also gives you
   control over whether or not to reset states when starting via the
   <code>States when starting</code> parameter on the for-iterator block.  A
   for-subsystem is very similar to a while-subsystem with the restriction that
   the number of iterations on any given time step is fixed.
