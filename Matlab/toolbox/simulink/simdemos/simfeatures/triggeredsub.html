<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Triggered Subsystem Demonstration </p>
<p>This demonstration shows the concept of triggered subsystems and what the 
different trigger types are.  A triggered subsystem is executed for one time step
only each time the trigger port transitions from false to true in a certain direction.
The transition of the trigger port may occur when the direction of the transition
is rising, falling or both rising and falling.</p>

<p>A rising transition occurs when the trigger signal transitions from zero or below
to a positive value.  A falling transition occurs when the trigger signal transitions
from zero or above to a negaive value.</p>

<p>After running the simulation, look closely at the top plot in the scope.  This shows
a sine wave, a waveform and the grounded value of zero.  As the waveform
transitions through zero, each of the subsystems is triggered appropriately.  The
output of each subsystem is equal to the current value of the sine wave at the time.</p>

<p>To help view exactly what is going on, you may want to turn the scope crosshair on.
You can do this by double clicking on the block that says Scope Crosshair.  This will
enable a set of crosshairs on the scope so that s you move your mouse you can line
corresponding values up across the plots. </p>
