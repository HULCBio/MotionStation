<h2>Custom Code and Hand Coded Blocks</h2>


<p>This model launches examples of different types of Simulink 
S-functions.  Simulink S-functions allow you to extend Simulink with new
hand coded blocks, interface to custom external code, and create live 
interfaces to other programs. Models containing S-functions in the 
following programming languages can be accessed through this 
demonstration:</p>

<ul>
<li>C
<li>C++
<li>M
<li>Fortran
<li>Ada
</ul>

<p>Each example contains a model that exercises an S-function block and 
a link for editing the S-function code.  You can also access the
main S-function file by using the Edit... button on the S-function
block dialog (which is under a mask in some of the models; use the 
"Look Under Mask" context menu item to access the S-function dialog in
this situation).</p>

<p>Additionally, the S-function Builder block is a masked version of the
S-function block that includes an easy to use editor that automatically
builds an S-function out of a core algorithm that you enter into it along
with input, output, and parameter attributes.  By default, the S-function
Builder also creates a TLC file for use with Real-Time Workshop and 
Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder.</p>
