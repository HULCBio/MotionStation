<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Advanced Enabled Subsystems</p>

<p>This demonstration shows what happens when a sine wave is fed into an enabled subsystem. The four subsystems in the model contain integrators, either discrete or continuous as described by the Subsystem name. After running the simulation, the two scopes show the results for the discrete enabled subsystems (top scope) and continuous enabled subsystems (bottom scope.)</p>

<p>Each Scope shows the output for all combinations of where the states or outputs of the enabled subsystem are either held or reset when the subsystem is disabled. The colors on the scope correspond to the following state and output configuration.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Yellow:</b> Reset states; Held outputs
<li><b>Purple:</b> Reset states; Reset outputs
<li><b>Cyan:</b> Held states; Held outputs
<li><b>Red:</b> Held states; Reset outputs
</ul>
