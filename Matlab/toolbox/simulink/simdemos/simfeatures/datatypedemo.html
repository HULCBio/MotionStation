<p>This demonstration shows how to use data types in Simulink.  For this simple
example, a sine wave with an amplitude of 150 is kept as a double, converted to
an 8-bit integer and converted to an unsigned 8-bit integer.  The resulting effects
of this are shown on a scope.  Notice that the signed integer is allowed to be
positive and negative but gets saturated above 128.  The unsigned integer is always
positive but does not get saturated until 256. </p>
