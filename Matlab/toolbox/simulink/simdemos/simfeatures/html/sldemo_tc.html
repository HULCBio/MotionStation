<h2>Approximating Nonlinear Relationships: Type S Thermocouple</h2>

<h3>Thermocouple Modeling and Signal Conversion</h3>

<p>The thermocouple is one of the  popular analog transducers today, 
along with other devices such as position sensors, strain gages, 
pressure transducers, and resistance temperature devices (RTDs).  
Operating under the principle of the Seebeck (or thermoelectric) effect, 
thermocouples have an empirically determined nonlinear behavior that is
well known over each junction type's useful operating range.  If you run 
the model, you will be able to see the cumulative effect of each 
component on dynamic measurement accuracy.</p>

<p>This demonstration will focus on models for each of these components 
in a dynamic temperature measurement system for a Type S (Platinum-10% 
Rhodium(+) versus Platinum(-) ) : a thermocouple device and probe 
assembly, a signal conditioning method, an analog to digital converter 
(ADC), and a software specification for converting the ADC output back 
into a temperature value.  An additional section shows how to obtain 
and use standard NIST ITS-90 thermocouple data with Simulink models. 
Look-up tables and a polynomial block are used in this design to 
capture the nonlinear behavior of the thermocouple.  Note that 
the polynomial block is a viable alternative to look-up tables for
some applications, minimizing ROM usage at the cost of some 
additional computation for the full polynomial representation.</p>

<h3>Simulating the Thermocouple Signal</h3>

<p>The two main features of the thermocouple model are the probe and bead 
dynamics and the thermoucouple's conversion of temperature into a 
millivolt signal. The probe+bead dynamics are modeled as a 30 msec first 
order system, and the nonlinear thermocouple behavior is modeled using the
segment 1 polynomial data from NIST Standard Database 60 for a Type S 
thermocouple from -50 to 1063 &deg;C.  For numerical stability, 
the coefficients were scaled to return microvolts from the polynomial 
block.  The output of the polynomial block is then scaled by 1e-6 using a 
gain block to convert the value to volts.</p>

An alternative implementation to using the polynomial is an interpolated 
look-up table.  Table data could be used in a look-up table block 
in place of the polynomial block.  Sampe data was constructed from NIST 
Standard Database 60 for a Type S thermocouple in file 
<a href="matlab:edit sldemo_create_tc_tabledata.m">
sldemo_create_tc_tabledata.m</a>.  Access to this database is described 
below in the section titled "Reference Data Download and Import Procedure".


<h3>Modeling the Input Conditioning Circuit and Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)</h3>

<p>The ADC in this model expects a 0 to 5 volt signal, so the raw thermocouple
sense voltage is biased and amplified corresponding to a range of -0.235 mV 
to 18.661 mV (-50 to 1765 degC).  A third order Butterworth anti-aliasing
filter was designed for Wn = 15 Hz using the Signal Processing Toolbox:</p>

<code>[num,den] = butter(3, 15*2*pi, 'low', 's')</code><br>

<p>The output of the anti-aliasing filter feeds a sample-and-hold device
that drives the quanization model.  Since the sample period is 20 msec in 
this example, the conversion time is ignored as it is typically 2 orders
of magnitude smaller for devices currently available.  (Note: if the 
conversion time were an appreciable fraction of the sample period, it 
could not be ignored as it would significantly affect the system's 
dynamics.)</p>

<p>The quantization algorithm in the model takes in a 0 to 5 volt signal 
and outputs a 12-bit digital word in a 16-bit signed integer.  A value 
of 0 corresponds to 0 Volts and a value of 4096 would correspond to 5 Volts.  
A change in the least significant bit (LSB) is about 1.2 mV.  As 12 bits 
can only reach the value of 4095, the highest voltage that can be read by 
this device is approximately 4.9988 Volts. In order to have no more than 
1/2 LSB error, the quantizer changes values midway between each voltage 
point, resulting in a 1/2-width interval at 0 Volts and a 3/2-width interval
just below 5 Volts.  The 
<a href="matlab:sldemo_adc_quantize">sldemo_adc_quantize</a> model allows
you to explore this component in more detail.</p>


<h3>Software Specification for Converting ADC output to Temperature Values</h3>

<p>The input conversion subsystem requires a 16 bit unsigned integer input 
from the ADC whose full scale range is 0 to 4095 counts, corresponding 
to -0.235 mV and 18.6564 mV thermocouple loop voltage.  The best accuracy 
and fastest algorithm for input conversion is a direct look-up table.  Since 
the input is an integer from 0 to 4095, a table can be constructed that 
gives the thermocouple temperature corresponding to each possible input value,
so the conversion process can be reduced to indexing into a table. However, 
this requires one number per ADC output value and for a 12-bit ADC, this
can be a burden in memory constrained environments.  For double precision
data, this is a 16 kB ROM requirement.  See file
<a href="matlab:edit sldemo_create_tc_tabledata.m">sldemo_create_tc_tabledata.m</a>
for the method used to construct the direct look-up table from the Type S
thermocouple reference data.  The error associated with this approach is 
entirely isolated to the table construction process as there is an output
value associated with every possible input value - the run-time look-up 
process introduces no additional error.</p>

<p>An interpolated table was also put into the model, using only 664 bytes.
This is a big reduction in ROM required compared to the direct table look-up, 
but it takes a bit longer to compute than an indirect memory access and 
introduces error into the measurement, which goes down as the number of 
points in the table increases.</p>

<h3>Thermocouple Reference Data Download and Import Procedure</h3>

<p>Using the <a href="http://srdata.nist.gov/its90/main/">
NIST ITS-90 Thermocouple Database</a> (Standard Reference Database 60, from 
NIST Monograph 175), you can access the standard reference data describing the 
behavior for the eight standard thermocouple types.  This database relates 
thermocouple output to the International Temperature Scale of 1990.  
Follow these steps to acquire and read in the data needed to fully 
exercise the support files included with this demo:

<OL>
<LI>Visit the 
<a href="http://srdata.nist.gov/its90/download/download.html">
NIST Standard database 60</a> 
site on the Internet and download the file <code>all.tab</code> to a local 
directory.  This file is the one under the 
<a href="http://srdata.nist.gov/its90/download/all.tab">All Thermocouple Types</a> 
hyperlink.  After the download is complete, return to this page.<br><br>

<font size="-1">(Note: this link was valid as of 20 Mar 2004. The data set is 
also available from the MATLAB Central downloads area.)</font></LI><br>

<LI><code>cd</code> to the directory where you downloaded the <code>all.tab</code>
 thermocouple database</LI><br>

<LI>Parse the database and convert it to a MATLAB structure array using the 
conversion tool <a href="matlab:edit readstdtcdata.m">readstdtcdata.m</a>:<br><br>

<code>
tcdata = readstdtcdata('all.tab'); save thermocouple_its90.mat tcdata;
</code><br><br>
(tip: highlight the above MATLAB code and use right mouse menuitem "Evaluate Selection" 
to execute it)</LI><br>

</OL>

<p>You now have a complete set of temperature (T, &deg;C) vs. voltage 
(E, mV) data, approximating polynomial coefficients, and inverse 
polynomial coefficients for the standard thermocouple types 
B, E, J, K, N, R, S, and T in the <code>tcdata</code> variable of 
file <code>thermocouple_its90.mat</code>.  The M-script in  
<a href="matlab:edit sldemo_create_tc_tabledata.m">
sldemo_create_tc_tabledata.m</a> uses this data to prepare lookup
table block parameters used in the demonstration model.</p>


<h3>Conditioning Reference Data for use in a Look-Up Table</h3>

<p>If you review the thermocouple data tables in the tcdata structure
or in <code>all.tab</code>, you will probably notice a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Repeated 0 &deg;C temperature points in the data</li>
<li>Repeated voltage points in the data due to the 3-digit output format</li>
<li>Non-monotonic behavior with two temperatures having the same output,<br> 
    e.g., for the Type B thermocouple, T(E) won't work but E(T) does work</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>readstdtcdata()</code> routine will remove the repeated 
0 &deg;C temperature points from the data, but the repeated voltages due 
to the data format and non-monotonic behavior of some of the curve ends 
must be dealt with on an individual basis.  A reference model named 
<a href="matlab:sldemo_tc_blocks">sldemo_tc_blocks.mdl</a> was 
constructed using <a href="matlab:edit sldemo_create_tc_blocks_data.m">
sldemo_create_tc_blocks_data.m</a>.  It contains look-up tables with 
data populated from the interpolating polynomials for the eight standard 
thermocouples in <code>all.tab</b>:</p>
