<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Clutch Simulation Using If Block</p>

<p>This demonstration shows how to use if/else subsystems to build a clutch model. An If subsystem models the clutch dynamics in the locked position while an else subsystem models the unlocked position. One or the other of the subsystems is enabled via the If block. The dot-dashed lines from the If block denote control signals, used to enable if/else (or other conditional) subsystems</p>

<p>After running the simulation, a GUI opens. Checking any of the boxes on the GUI produces a plot of any of the following variables (versus time).</p>

<ol>
<li>Clutch Pedal input: The variable Fn in the MATLAB Workspace
<li>Engine Torque input: The variable Tin in the MATLAB Workspace 
<li>we: Engine velocity
<li>wv: Vehicle velocity when the clutch is unlocked
<li>w: Vehicle velocity when the clutch is locked
<li>Locked Flag: 1 when the clutch is locked. Zero when unlocked.
<li>Lockup Flag: 1 at the point in time when the clutch locks.
<li>Break-Apart Flag: 1 when the clutch is unlocked. Zero when locked.
<li>Friction Torque Required for Lockup
<li>Max Static Friction Torque
</ol>
