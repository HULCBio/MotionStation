<p>This demonstration shows how to model a two degree of freedom vehicle suspension system in Simulink. Two masked subsystems model the front and rear suspension of the vehicle. For each subsystem, the spring and damping rates of the suspension can be modified.</p>

<p>Running the simulation by double-clicking on the yellow block at the bottom left produces a plot showing various characteristics of the suspension system, including the following.</p>

<ul>
<li>THETAdot: Angular velocity
<li>Zdot: Velocity
<li>Ff: Reaction force at the front wheel
<li>h: Road height
<li>V: Moment due to the vehicle acceleration and deceleration
</ul>
