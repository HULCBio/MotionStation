% Simulink: Automotive model demonstrations and samples.
%
% Demonstration models (.mdl).
%   absbrake     - ABS brake system.
%   clutch       - Clutch engagement model.
%   engine       - Automotive engine model.
%   enginewc     - Automotive engine model with speed control.
%   suspn        - Automotive suspension model.
%
% Demonstration scripts (.m).
%   runabs   - Front end script for absbrake.
%   suspgrph - Front end for suspn.
%
% Execute the MATLAB command "demo simulink" to see a menu of most demos
% and models in this directory.  The demo menu is also available by
% opening the Demos block in the main Simulink block library (which is 
% displayed by typing "simulink" at the MATLAB command line or by pressing
% the Simulink toolbar icon). 
%
% Demos can also be run by typing their names at the MATLAB command line.
%
% Support routines and data files.
%   absdata.m    - Data for absbrake.
%   clutchplot.m - Plotting routine for clutch.
%   suspdat.m    - Data for suspn.
%   clutch.mat   - Data for clutch.
