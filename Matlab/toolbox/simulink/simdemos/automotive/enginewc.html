<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Engine Timing With Closed Loop Control</p>

<p>This demonstration shows how to use Triggered subsystems to model engine timing, including a feedback controller. Different subsystems in the diagram  model the mathmatical representation of various automotive systems, include the following.</p>

<ul>
<li>Throttle & Manifold
<li>Compression
<li>Combustion
<li>Vehicle Dynamics
<li>Valve Timing
<li>Controller
</ul>

<p>The valve timing subsystem generates a signal that triggers the Controller and Compression subsystems twice per revolution of the crank (calculated from the crank speed.)

<p>A speed set point (in rpm) from the Step block drives the simulation. The controller calculates the necessary throttle angle based on the desired rpm and the crank speed that is calculated by the vehicle dynamics.</p>

<p>After running the simulation, the Scopes show the engine speed and the throttle angle compared to the load torque.
