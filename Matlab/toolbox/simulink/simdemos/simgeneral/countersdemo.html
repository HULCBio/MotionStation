<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Enabled Subsystem Demonstration </p>

<p>This demonstration uses counter circuits to contrast the execution of
blocks in enabled subsystems and triggered subsystems for the same
control signal.  After running the simulation, the scope shows three plots.  </p>

<p>The first of these plots shows the control signal which is the output of the 
discrete pulse generator. </p>

<p>The second plot shows the output of the counter circuit in the enabled
subsystem.  The counter increments while the subsystem is enabled and 
then holds its output when the subsystem is disabled.  The counter resets to
zero when the subsystem is re-enabled because the enable port was
configured to reset states when enabling.</p>

<p>The third plot shows the output of the counter circuit in the triggered
subsystem.  The counter increments every rising edge of the control
signal. </p>
