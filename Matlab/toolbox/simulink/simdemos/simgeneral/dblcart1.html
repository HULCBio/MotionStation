<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Double Spring Mass System Simulation</p>

<p>This system models a double spring-mass-damper
system with a periodically varying forcing function. </p>
<p>Associated with the demo is an animation function that
will automatically open a figure window and display to it. </p>
<p>In this system, the only sensor is attached to the mass
on the left, and the actuator is attached to the mass on
the left. State estimation and LQR control are used. </p>
