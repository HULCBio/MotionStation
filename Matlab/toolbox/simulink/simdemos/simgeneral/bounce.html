<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Tracking a Bouncing Ball</p>

<p>A rubber ball is thrown into the air with a velocity of 15
meters per second from a height of 10 m.  The position
 of the ball is shown in the lower plot of the scope, and 
the velocity of the ball is shown in the upper plot. </p>
<p>This system uses a reset-integrator to change the
direction of the ball as it comes into contact with
the ground </p>
