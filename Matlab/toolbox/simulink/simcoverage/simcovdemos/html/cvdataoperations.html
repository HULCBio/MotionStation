%% Operations on Coverage Data
% This demonstration shows how to use the overloaded operators +, * and - to
% combine coverage results into a union, intersection, or set difference of
% results.

%   Copyright 1990-2003 The MathWorks, Inc.
%   $Revision: 1.1.6.1 $  $Date: 2003/09/18 18:07:37 $

%% Example Model
% Open a simple model with two mutually-exclusive enabled
% subsystems.  
%  

open_system('cv_mutual_exclusion')

%%
% Use the commands |cvtest| and |cvsim| to start simulation. Initially, the
% value of the Constant block is 0, which forces Subsystem 2 to execute.
%  

test1 = cvtest('cv_mutual_exclusion');
data1 = cvsim(test1)

%%
% The following commands change the value of the Constant block to 1 before
% running the second simulation. This forces Subsystem 1 to execute.
%  

set_param('cv_mutual_exclusion/Constant','Value','1');
test2 = cvtest('cv_mutual_exclusion');
data2 = cvsim(test2)

%%
% We use the |decisioninfo| command to extract the overall coverage from each
% test and list it as a percentage.  
%
% Note: While both tests have 50% coverage, whether or not they cover the same
%       50% is unknown.
%  

cov1 = decisioninfo(data1,'cv_mutual_exclusion');
percent1 = 100*(cov1(1)/cov1(2))

cov2 = decisioninfo(data2,'cv_mutual_exclusion');
percent2 = 100*(cov2(1)/cov2(2))

%% Finding the union of coverage
% Use the + operator to derive a third cvdata object representing the union of
% data1 and data2 cvdata objects.
%
% Note: New cvdata objects created from combinations of other simulation results
% are marked with the type property set as DERIVED_DATA.
%  

dataUnion = data1 + data2

%% 
% Notice that the union of the coverage is 100% because there is no overlap in
% the coverage between the two sets.
%  

covU = decisioninfo(dataUnion,'cv_mutual_exclusion');
percentU = 100*(covU(1)/covU(2))

%% Finding the intersection of coverage
% Confirm that the coverage does not overlap between the two tests by
% intersecting data1 and data2 with the * operator.  As expected, there is 0% 
% coverage in the intersection.
%  

dataIntersection = data1 * data2

covI = decisioninfo(dataIntersection,'cv_mutual_exclusion');
percentI = 100*(covI(1)/covI(2))

%% Using derived cvdata objects
% Derived cvdata objects can be used in all reporting and analysis commands,
% and as inputs to subsequent operations.  As an example, generate a coverage
% report from the derived dataIntersection object.
%  

cvhtml('intersect_cov', dataIntersection);

% Input to another operation
newUnion = dataUnion + dataIntersection

%% Computing the coverage (set) difference 
% The - operator is used to form a cvdata object that represents the set 
% difference between left and right operands.  The result of the operation
% contains the coverage points that are satisfied in the left operand but not
% satisfied in the right operand.  This operation is useful for determining how
% much additional coverage is attributed to a particular test.
%  
% In the following example, the difference between the union of the first and
% second test coverage and the first test coverage should indicate how much
% additional coverage the second test provided.  As already shown, since none
% of the coverage points overlapped, the new coverage from test 2 is 50%.
%  

newCov2 = dataUnion - data1

covN = decisioninfo(newCov2,'cv_mutual_exclusion');
percentN = 100*(covN(1)/covN(2))

%%
% Finish the demo by closing the model.
%  

close_system('cv_mutual_exclusion',0);
