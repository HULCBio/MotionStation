    [H,W] = FREQZ(Hd,N) returns the N-point complex frequency response
    vector H and the N-point frequency vector W in radians/sample of the
    discrete-time filter Hd.  The frequency response is evaluated at N
    points equally spaced around the upper half of the unit circle. If N

    FREQZ(Hd) with no output argument will launch FVTool in the Magnitude
    and Phase Response.
 
    [H,W] = FREQZ(Hd) returns a matrix H if Hd is a vector.  Each column of
    the matrix corresponds to each filter in the vector.  If a row vector
    of frequency points is specified, each row of the matrix corresponds to
    each filter in the vector.

      <p>To create a DFILT object, you need to select the structure to be used. For example, you can implement a linear-phase even-order

      <h2>Getting and Setting the Filter Coefficients<a name="6"></a></h2>

         Furthermore the 'ResetBeforeFiltering' property is 'on' which means that the object is reset before the filter is run. This
         allows to filter the same sequence twice and produce the same output.
