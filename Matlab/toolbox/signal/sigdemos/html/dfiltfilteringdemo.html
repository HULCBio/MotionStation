      <h1>Advanced filtering with discrete-time filter (DFILT) objects</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>The filtering operation is implemented for different structures. This is far more flexible than the usual FILTER(b,a,x) function
            which always implements transposed direct-form II. Another benefit of filtering with objects comes from the fact that the
            states of the filter can be saved after each filtering operation. This demo discusses both features.

      <h2>Filtering without Initial Conditions<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>By default, the states of the filter, stored in the 'States' property, are each initialized to zero. Furthermore the 'ResetBeforeFiltering'
         property is 'on' which means that the object is reset before the filter is run. This allows to filter the same sequence twice
         and produce the same output.

</pre><h2>Specifying Initial Conditions<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>The user can specify initial conditions by turning the 'ResetBeforeFiltering' property 'off' and setting the 'States' property.
         If a scalar is specified, it will be expanded to the correct number of states. If a vector is specified, its length must be
         equal to the number of states. For example:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">x = randn(99,1);

hdf1.ResetBeforeFiltering=<span class="string">'off'</span>;
hdf1.States = 1; <span class="comment">% Uses scalar expansion</span>
ydf1 = filter(hdf1,x);

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dfiltfilteringdemo_01.png"> <p>Notice how the two filtered sequences are different at the begining. This is due to the initial conditions. Since the filter
         structures are different, the effect of the initial conditions on the output is different. As the effect of the initial conditions
         dies out, the two sequences become the same.
      </p>
      <h2>Streaming Data<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <p>Setting the 'ResetBeforeFiltering' property 'off' is a convenient feature for streaming data to the filter. Breaking up a

      <h2>Working with Second-Order Sections<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>From a numerical accuracy standpoint, it is usually preferable to work with IIR filters in second-order sections (SOS) form
         and avoid  forming the transfer function. DFILT objects provide fine-tuned analysis algorithms for SOS filters that avoid
         the numerical problems associated with transfer functions.

hdf1  = dfilt.df1(b,a);  % Direct-form I implementation
hdf1t = dfilt.df1t(b,a); % Transposed direct-form I implementation
hdf2  = dfilt.df2(b,a);  % Direct-form II implementation

x = ones(5,1);

%% Specifying Initial Conditions
% The user can specify initial conditions by turning the
% 'ResetBeforeFiltering' property 'off' and setting the 'States' property.
% If a scalar is specified, it will be expanded to the correct number of

end
%%
% We verify that ydf1loop(signal filtered by sections) is equal to ydf1 (entire signal filtered at once).
max(abs(ydf1loop(:)-ydf1))

%% Multi-Channel Signals
% If the input signal x is a matrix, each column of x is seen by the filter
