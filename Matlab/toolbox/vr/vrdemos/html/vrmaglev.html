<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Magnetic Levitation Model</p>

<p>
<code><strong>vrmaglev</strong></code> is an example showing the interaction between dynamic models in Simulink 
and virtual worlds. The Simulink model represents the HUMUSOFT 
<a href="http://www.humusoft.com/models/ce152.htm">CE152 Magnetic Levitation</a>
educational / presentation scale model. The plant model is controlled by a PID controller 
with feed forward to cope with the nonlinearity of the magnetic levitation system.
</p>

<p>
The position of the ball responds to the changing value of the setpoint. 
You can observe this change not only in the Scope window, but also in a viewer window 
displaying the virtual world. After switching the input from the signal generator to the <strong>VR Source</strong> 
block, you can use your mouse to drag the ball to a new position. Note that the position of the ball represents 
the real dynamics of the system. If you switch the VRML viewer to the Camera 3 viewpoint, you can observe and control 
the ball easier.
</p>

<p>
The dragging effect is achieved by using the VRML PlaneSensor attached to the ball geometry with its 
output restricted to <0,1> in the vertical coordinate and processed by the VR Source block.
