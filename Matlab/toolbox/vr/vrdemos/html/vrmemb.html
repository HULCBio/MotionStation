<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Rotating Membrane with MATLAB GUI</p>

<p>
The <code><strong>vrmemb</strong></code> example shows how to use a MATLAB-generated 3-D graphic object with the Virtual Reality Toolbox.
The famous membrane was generated by the <code><strong>logo</strong></code> function and saved in the VRML format using the MATLAB standard function <code><strong>vrml</strong></code>.
You can save all <strong>Handle Graphics</strong> objects this way and use them with the Virtual Reality Toolbox as components of associated virtual worlds.
</p>
<p>
After starting the demo, you will see a control panel with two sliders and three check boxes.
Use the sliders to rotate and zoom the membrane while you use the check boxes to determine which axis to rotate around.
</p>
<p>
In the VRML scene, it is interesting to notice the text object. It is a child of the VRML <strong>Billboard</strong> node. 
You can configure this node so that its local Z-axis turns to point to the viewer at all times. 
This can be useful for modelling virtual control panels and head-up displays (HUD).
