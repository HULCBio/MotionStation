<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Plane Take-off</p>

<p>
The <code><strong>vrtkoff</strong></code> example represents a simplified aircraft taking-off from a runway. 
There are several viewpoints defined in this model, both static and attached to the plane, 
allowing you to see the take-off from various perspectives. 
</p>

<p>
The model demonstrates the technique of combining several objects imported or obtained from different sources 
(CAD packages, general 3-D modelers etc.) into a virtual reality scene. 
Usually it is necessary for you to wrap such imported objects by an additional VRML <strong>Transform</strong> node. 
This wrapper allows you to set appropriately the scaling, position, and orientation of the objects 
to fit in the scene. In this example, the aircraft model from the <strong>V-Realm Builder</strong> Object Library 
was incorporated into the scene. 
</p>

<p>
We prepared a slightly different object for you with same scene in the file <strong>vrtkoff2.wrl</strong>. 
You can try to associate this file from the VR Sink block dialog box to see the difference.
