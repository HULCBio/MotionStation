<p>
This demonstration illustrates the use of the Virtual Reality Toolbox with the MATLAB interface for manipulating complex objects.
</p>

<p>
In this demonstration, matrix-type data is transferred between MATLAB and a virtual reality world.
Using this feature, you can achieve massive color changes or morphing. This is useful for visualizing various physical processes.
We use precalculated data of time-based temperature distribution in an L-shaped metal block and send that data to the virtual world. 
This forms an animation with relatively large changes.
</p>

<p>
This is a step-by-step demonstration. The following features are shown:
<ul>
	<li>Reshaping the object </li>
	<li>Applying the color palette to visualize distributed parameters across an object shape </li>
	<li>Working with VRML Text objects </li>
	<li>Animating a scene </li>
	<li>Synchronization of multiple scene properties. </li>
</ul>
At the end of this example, you can preserve the virtual world object in the MATLAB workspace, 
and then save the resulting scene to a corresponding VRML file or to carry-out other subsequent operations on it.
