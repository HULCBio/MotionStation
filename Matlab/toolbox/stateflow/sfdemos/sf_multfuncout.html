<p>Multiple Stateflow Charts</p>

<p>The main purpose of this demonstration is to illustrate the use of feedback when using function-call 
outputs. The 'Source' chart sends the signal 'out_fcn_two' when transition to from State A to State B or
vice versa. 'out_fcn_two' activates 'Counter' everytime it is sent out. 'Counter' also sends out a data
output, 'out_one' which is fed back to 'Source' as data 'Input from Simulink'. If the source is in State B,
then a transition is taken from State B to State C if 'out_one' is greater than 10. If this transition is taken,
then a new function-call event, 'out_fcn' is sent to the 'Delay' chart. The 'Delay' chart simply adds a 1
to its output, 'out_two' everytime it is activated. In the output, 'Scope', notice that there is an initial delay
that is the time it takes for the first 'out_fcn' to be sent.
