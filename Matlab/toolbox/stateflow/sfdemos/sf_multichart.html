<p>Library Charts</p>

<p>You can create Stateflow chart libraries just like any other Simulink libraries. In this
demonstration two charts from the same library are being used. The charts receveive
two different inputs: a sine wave and its inverse. Notice that these charts cannot be 
modified or edited; they are treated as any other Simulink library block. In order to modify
the chart, you need to right-click and select ' Link Options... --> Disable Link'. Once you
disable the link, the chart is not longer greyed out and changes can be made. These 
changes can then be propagated to the Stateflow library block by right-clicking and 
selecting 'Library Options... --> Restore Link' and then 'Update Library'.
