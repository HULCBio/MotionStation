<p>Temporal Logic using the BEFORE function </p>
<p>The BEFORE function allows you to execute a transition or an action before a certain number
of events occur. In this example, we illustrate the use of the BEFORE function for three different
conditions with three different constraints. </p>

<p>In superstate One, two conditions need to be met for the transition out of A_state: signal_one has
to be less than 5 before 10 events occur. Since both these conditions are met, the output is set to 
1 (after all three parallel states are initialized).  </p>

<p>In superstate Two, two different conditions need to be met for the transition out of B_state: 
signal_two has to be less greater than 10 before 20 events occur. These conditions are met later
on in the simulation, when signal_two becomes greater than 10. </p>

<p>Finally, in superstate Three, two other conditions need to be met for the transition out of C_state:
signal_three has to be greater than 11 before 10 events occur. Since this never occurs, output3 is
is never set to 1 and thus remains 0 for whole simulation. </p>
