<p>Fixed-Point Graphical Functions</p>

<p>Fixed-point data types can also be used as inputs to Graphical Functions within Stateflow. In this 
demonstration, we provide a 16 bit signed input to the Stateflow chart from Simulink and send out
double. Within the chart, a graphical function uses takes the input and multiplies it by 3 if the value
is greater than or equal to zero or by -3 if the value is less than zero. The output is then converted
back to a double-precision float and sent to a scope block.
