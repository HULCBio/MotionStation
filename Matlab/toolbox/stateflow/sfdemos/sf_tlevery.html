<p>Temporal Logic using the EVERY function </p>

<p>This demonstration illustrates the advantage of using the EVERY function to call a graphical function when 
certain events occur. Notice how complicated it becomes when you try to accomplish the same behavior 
without the use of temporal logic functions.</p>

<p>In the Temporal Logic chart, we specify that every 5 secs (events), we will add one to the local variable
'count'. We then say that every 10 secs, we will call the graphical function, double_counter, which is a function
that doubles its input, and give it the value of 'count', Notice that only one state and one graphical function 
block are needed to accomplish this task when using temporal logic.</p>

<p>In the Without Temporal Logic chart, we create the same behavior as the Temporal Logic chart. In order to 
accomplish this, we need to use 4 state blocks and one graphical function block. Also, it becomes much more 
difficult to follow the transitions and events that take place in the model. Again, the graphical function,
double_counter is called using 'count' as the input.</p>
