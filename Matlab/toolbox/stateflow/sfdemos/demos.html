<p>Stateflow provides a complete environment in which you can model all types of reactive systems.  It works closely with Simulink to provide a complete system simulation environment. </p>
<p>In addition, Stateflow can produce efficient production-quality code so that you can turn your thoughts and ideas into real systems. </p>
