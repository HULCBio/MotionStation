<p>Graphical Function Demonstration </p>
<p>This demonstration illustrates how graphical functions can be exported and used as a means for 
accessing data. The output shown in the scope block, is equal to 1 when the manual switch is in the
On_switch state, or 0 when the switch is in the Off_switch state. </p>

<p>The Caller chart is triggered by the Manual Switch. Graphical functions which are defined in the Callee
chart, are then called by the Caller chart. In the Callee chart, the output is set to 0 in state A and set to
1 in state B. The graphical functions which are called by the Caller chart, first check if state A is active
and then send and transition even signal to the appropriate state. This method allows you to create
flexible models which contain different triggering events that define the final output. </p>
