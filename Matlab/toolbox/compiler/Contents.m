%
% Compiler
%   mcc              - MATLAB Compiler driver. Called from
%                      either the MATLAB prompt or the system
%                      prompt.
%
% Component tools
%   mbuild           - Used by the compiler to compile and build
%                      certain components. It must be configured
%                      for the compiler to work. At the MATLAB
%                      prompt issue:
%
%                      >> mbuild -setup
%
%                      and answer any questions.
%
%  extractCTF        - (extractCTF.exe on PC) is a stand-alone
%                      utility to extract a CTF archive without
%                      running the stand-alone application that uses
%                      it. One of the scenarios where this utility
%                      will be useful is for system administrators
%                      who would like to make a MATLAB Compiler-based
%                      application available to the users over the
%                      network and the users do not have write
%                      permission on the network directory.
%
% MATLAB Common Runtime (MCR) tools
%   
%   buildmcr         - Creates a package of files that makes up
%                      the MRC for the local platform
%                      architecture.
%   MCRInstaller.zip - Is the MCR package file generated by
%                      'buildmcr'. For a specific architecture,
%                      ARCH, this file is placed in the
%                      directory:
% 
%                      $MATLAB/toolbox/compiler/deploy/$ARCH
%
%                      To recreate this file, the old copy must be
%                      removed manually. To install the MCR, the
%                      package file must be 'unzipped' manually
%                      at the root directory chosen by the user
%                      for the MCR. To unzip use 'WinZip' or
%                      equivalent on Windows or 'unzip' on UNIX.
%                      A version of 'unzip' on UNIX for a specific
%                      architecture, ARCH, is shipped in:
%
%                      $MATLAB/toolbox/compiler/deploy/$ARCH
