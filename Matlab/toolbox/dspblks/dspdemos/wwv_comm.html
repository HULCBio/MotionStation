<p>WWV is the call sign of a US government radio station that transmits frequency reference standards and time code information with a timing accuracy of 10 microseconds and a frequency accuracy of 1 part in 100 billion. This demo simulates the transmission of a WWV signal and demonstrates implementation of the subsequent receiver and decoder blocks. The receiver design serves as a simple example of the use of Simulink, Signal Processing Blockset, Stateflow and Real-Time Workshop.</p>
