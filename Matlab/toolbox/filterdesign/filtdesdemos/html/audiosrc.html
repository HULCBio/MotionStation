      <h2>Creating the Multirate Filters<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>All sample-rate conversion filters are created in the same way. One must specify first the interpolation factor L, then the
         decimation factor M and finally the FIR filter coefficients. Note that L and M must be relatively prime. Otherwise, they are
         converted to relatively prime factors and a warning is issued. If no filter coefficients are given, a lowpass filter is designed
         for you with a cutoff frequency of pi/max(L,M) and a gain of L in the passband.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">h1 = mfilt.firsrc(4,3); <span class="comment">% Default filter</span>
h2 = mfilt.firfracinterp(8,6);
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">Warning: L and M are not relatively prime. Converting ratio 8/6 to 4/3.
The cutoff frequency of the filter should be approximately pi/4.
</pre><h2>Decreasing the Sample Rate by a Fractional Factor<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>Suppose an audio signal recorded at 48kHz must be converted to 32kHz for broadcasting. Consider the following audio sample

      <p>The interpolation factor for this case is 2 and the decimation factor is 3. We can use a fractional decimator to achieve this.
         To keep things simple, we stick to the default filter that is designed for us. We could also use our own lowpass filter by
         specifying the coefficients as a third input argument: hfd = mfilt.firfracdecim(L,M,COEFFS).

         but since it is running 3 times faster than the 32 kHz signal, it is equivalent to 12 low speed samples.
