      <h1>Getting Started with Fixed-Point Filters</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>As filter designers begin to use digital filters in applications where power limitations and size constraints drive the filter
            design, they move from double-precision, floating-point filters to fixed-point filters. This demo showcases how to analyze
            the quantization effects introduced by such a conversion using discrete-time filter objects (DFILT).
