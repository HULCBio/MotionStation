<p><b>Design and analyze fixed-point, adaptive, and multirate filters</b></p>

<p><img src="new_fdatool.gif" width="200" height="166" border="0"
align="right">The Filter Design Toolbox is a collection of tools that provides
advanced techniques for designing, simulating, and analyzing digital filters. It
extends the capabilities of the Signal Processing Toolbox by adding <a 
href="cademo.html">filter architectures</a> and <a 
href="firgrdemo.html">design methods</a> for complex real-time DSP
applications.</p>

<p>The toolbox also 
provides functions that simplify the design of fixed-point filters and the
analysis of quantization effects. The 
quantized algorithms in the toolbox will 
match the output of the algorithms on a fixed-point DSP, FPGA, or ASIC exactly
because the simulation is bit-true. You can easily
iterate your design in the MATLAB environment before hardware
implementation.</p>

<p>The toolbox provides an extensive collection of <a 
href="mfiltgettingstarteddemo.html">multirate filters</a>. These filters
include decimators and interpolators, and fractional sample-rate converters that
are frequently used in <a href="audiosrc.html">digital audio</a>
applications.</p>

<p>The toolbox also contains a comprehensive suite of <a 
href="adaptdemo.html">adaptive filters</a> and specialized tools to analyze
the filter's performance. Adaptive filters are commonly used in areas such as
<a href="adaptequaldemo.html">digital communications</a> and <a 
href="adaptrlsdemo.html">noise cancellation</a>.</p>
