      <p>There are several parameters for a fixed-point direct-form FIR filter. To start with, it is best to concentrate on the coefficient
         wordlength and fractionlength (scaling). First we use the Filter Visualization Tool to compare the quantized coefficients

      <p>To determine the number of bits being used in the fixed-point filter, we simply look at the CoeffWordlength. To determine

         2^(-17). 16 bits is just the default number used for coefficients, but the 2^(-17) weight has been computed automatically
         to represent the coefficients with the best precision possible. This is controlled through the 'CoeffAutoScale' property.
         This property can be set to false if manual control of the coefficient scaling is desired. We simply verify that auto scaling

         continue to use 16 bits in this demonstration. As a rule-of-thumb, one should expect an attainable attenuation of about 5
         dB per bit.
      </p>
      <h2>Fixed-Point Filtering<a name="9"></a></h2>
      <p>Our main purpose is to evaluate the accuracy of the fixed-point filter when compared to a double-precision floating point
         version. We will see that it is not sufficient to have a faithful representation of the coefficients that keep the magnitude
         response approximately the same.
      </p>
      <h2>Generating Random Test Input Data<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>Since we just want to evaluate accuracy, we will use some random data to filter and compare against. We will create a quantizer,
         with a range of [-1,1) to generate random uniformly distributed white-noise data using 16 bits of wordlength.

xin = fi(xq,true,16,15);
</pre><h2>Generating a Baseline Output to Compare Against<a name="11"></a></h2>
      <p>When evaluating accuracy of fixed-point filtering, there are three quantities to consider:</p>
      <p>1. The "ideal" output, this quantity is what we would like to compute. It    is computed using the reference coefficients
         and double-precision    floating-point arithmetic.
      </p>
      <p>2. The best we can hope for, this is the best we can hope to achieve. It    is computed using the quantized coefficients and
         double-precision    floating-point arithmetic.
      </p>
      <p>3. What we can actually compute, this is the output computed using the    quantized coefficients and fixed-point arithmetic.</p>
      <p>Clearly we want to compare what we can actually compute to the best we can hope for. This last quantity can be computed by
         casting the fixed-point filter to double and filtering with double-precision floating-point arithmetic.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">xdouble = double(xin);
hdouble = double(h);
ydouble = filter(hdouble,xdouble);
</pre><p>For completeness we show how to compute the "ideal" output. And how much the effect of solely quantizing the coefficients
         affects the output of the filter.

</pre><h2>Computing the Fixed-Point Output<a name="14"></a></h2>
      <p>Next we will perform the actual fixed-point filtering. Once again, the best we can hope to achieve is to have an output identical
         to ydouble.

  9.7186e-004

</pre><h2>Improving the Result<a name="16"></a></h2>
      <p>At first glance, the output may seem reasonably close to the best we can hope for. Certainly by plotting y and ydouble there
         is hardly any visual difference (it is necessary to zoom-in to notice any difference).

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="dffirfxptdemo_04.png"> <p>The question is, can we improve the output accuracy. To address this, we first examine the output to determine the necessary

    16

</pre><pre class="codeinput">get(h,<span class="string">'OutputFracLength'</span>)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     9

</pre><p>This tells us that 16 bits are being used to represent the output and that the LSB is weighed by 2^(-9). These settings are
         able to cover the range [-64, 64), which is way too large for the maximum absolute value of the output. The price to pay is
         reduced precision. The issue has to do with the output mode:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">get(h,<span class="string">'OutputMode'</span>)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">

AvoidOverflow

</pre><p>The avoid overflow setting is a very conservative, worst-case scenario, setting. It is there to avoid overflows regardless
         of the input signal and regardless of the actual value of the filter coefficients. A more accurate setting is best precision.
         This accommodates to each input signal and determines the best precision possible on a case by case basis.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">set(h,<span class="string">'OutputMode'</span>, <span class="string">'BestPrecision'</span>);
y = filter(h,xin);

</pre><pre class="codeinput">norm(double(y)-ydouble,inf) <span class="comment">% max deviation</span>
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

  1.5251e-005

</pre><p>With these settings, the total and maximum errors have diminished significantly. We are still using 16 bits to represent the
         output, but the scaling has been improved to obtain the improved precision.
      </p>
      <h2>Further Reducing the Output Quantization<a name="25"></a></h2>
      <p>To isolate any other quantization errors being introduced in the filter, we can eliminate quantization error at the output
         completely by setting the output to have the same specifications as the accumulator. This can be thought of as being able
         to "look inside" the accumulator:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">set(h,<span class="string">'OutputMode'</span>,<span class="string">'SpecifyPrecision'</span>);
set(h,<span class="string">'OutputWordLength'</span>,get(h,<span class="string">'AccumWordLength'</span>));
set(h,<span class="string">'OutputFracLength'</span>,get(h,<span class="string">'AccumFracLength'</span>));
y = filter(h,xin);
norm(double(y)-ydouble)     <span class="comment">% total error</span>
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     0

</pre><pre class="codeinput">norm(double(y)-ydouble,inf) <span class="comment">% max deviation</span>
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

     0

</pre><p>The errors are exactly zero, showing that no further quantization is being introduced in the accumulator. The products are
         set by default to full precision, so we know that no errors are occurring there.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, it is usually not possible to have a full 40-bit output of the filter, so that some difference between y and ydouble
         is expected. Nevertheless, we have verified that the difference in this case is due solely to output quantization (this is
         not always the case, bits may be lost in the accumulator in some cases - in fact overflow may occur).
      </p>
      <h2>The Advantages of Having Guard Bits<a name="28"></a></h2>
      <p>If compare the product settings, with the accumulator settings:</p><pre class="codeinput">get(h,<span class="string">'ProductWordLength'</span>)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

    32

</pre><pre class="codeinput">get(h,<span class="string">'ProductFracLength'</span>)

    40

</pre><pre class="codeinput">get(h,<span class="string">'AccumFracLength'</span>)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

    32

</pre><p>We notice that the accumulator has 8 extra bits available. This is typical of most fixed-point DSP processors. These bits
         are usually referred to as guard bits. They provide a safety net for intermediate overflows. The easiest way of appreciating
         their value is to remove them and see what happens (we adjust the output setting accordingly),
      </p><pre class="codeinput">set(h,<span class="string">'AccumMode'</span>,<span class="string">'SpecifyPrecision'</span>);
set(h,<span class="string">'AccumWordLength'</span>,get(h,<span class="string">'ProductWordLength'</span>));

      <h2>Avoiding Overflow with No Guard Bits<a name="36"></a></h2>
      <p>It is possible to not have overflow even if guard bits are not available. The easiest way to do this is to use the keep the

%    is computed using the reference coefficients and double-precision
%    floating-point arithmetic.
%
% 2. The best we can hope for, this is the best we can hope to achieve. It
%    is computed using the quantized coefficients and double-precision
%    floating-point arithmetic.
%
% 3. What we can actually compute, this is the output computed using the
%    quantized coefficients and fixed-point arithmetic.
%
% Clearly we want to compare what we can actually compute to the best we
% can hope for. This last quantity can be computed by casting the
% fixed-point filter to double and filtering with
% double-precision floating-point arithmetic.
xdouble = double(xin);
hdouble = double(h);
ydouble = filter(hdouble,xdouble);

%%
% For completeness we show how to compute the "ideal" output. And how much
% the effect of solely quantizing the coefficients affects the output of
% the filter.
yideal = filter(href,xdouble);
norm(yideal-ydouble)     % total error
%%
norm(yideal-ydouble,inf) % max deviation

%% Computing the Fixed-Point Output
% Next we will perform the actual fixed-point filtering. Once again, the
% best we can hope to achieve is to have an output identical to ydouble.
y = filter(h,xin);
norm(double(y)-ydouble)     % total error
%%
norm(double(y)-ydouble,inf) % max deviation

%% Improving the Result
% At first glance, the output may seem reasonably close to the best we can
% hope for. Certainly by plotting y and ydouble there is hardly any visual
% difference (it is necessary to zoom-in to notice any difference).
plot([ydouble,double(y)])
xlabel('Samples'); ylabel('Amplitude')
legend('ydouble','y')
set(gcf, 'Color', [1 1 1])

%%
% The question is, can we improve the output accuracy. To address this, we
% first examine the output to determine the necessary range to represent
% it.
norm(double(y),inf) % Maximum absolute value of y

%% Changing the Output Settings
% Next we examine the output settings.
get(h,'OutputWordLength')
%%
get(h,'OutputFracLength')

%%
% This tells us that 16 bits are being used to represent the output and
% that the LSB is weighed by 2^(-9). These settings are able to cover the
% range [-64, 64), which is way too large for the maximum absolute value of
% the output. The price to pay is reduced precision. The issue has to do
% with the output mode:
get(h,'OutputMode')

%%
% The avoid overflow setting is a very conservative, worst-case scenario,
% setting. It is there to avoid overflows regardless of the input signal
% and regardless of the actual value of the filter coefficients. A more
% accurate setting is best precision. This accommodates to each input signal
% and determines the best precision possible on a case by case basis.
set(h,'OutputMode', 'BestPrecision');
y = filter(h,xin);
get(h,'OutputFracLength')
%%
norm(double(y)-ydouble)     % total error
%%
norm(double(y)-ydouble,inf) % max deviation

%%
% With these settings, the total and maximum errors have diminished
% significantly. We are still using 16 bits to represent the output, but
% the scaling has been improved to obtain the improved precision.

%% Further Reducing the Output Quantization
% To isolate any other quantization errors being introduced in the filter,
% we can eliminate quantization error at the output completely by setting
% the output to have the same specifications as the accumulator. This can
% be thought of as being able to "look inside" the accumulator:
set(h,'OutputMode','SpecifyPrecision');
set(h,'OutputWordLength',get(h,'AccumWordLength'));
set(h,'OutputFracLength',get(h,'AccumFracLength'));
y = filter(h,xin);
norm(double(y)-ydouble)     % total error
%%
norm(double(y)-ydouble,inf) % max deviation

%%
% The errors are exactly zero, showing that no further quantization is being
% introduced in the accumulator. The products are set by default to full
% precision, so we know that no errors are occurring there. 
%
% Of course, it is usually not possible to have a full 40-bit output of the
% filter, so that some difference between y and ydouble is expected.
% Nevertheless, we have verified that the difference in this case is due
% solely to output quantization (this is not always the case, bits may be
% lost in the accumulator in some cases - in fact overflow may occur).

%% The Advantages of Having Guard Bits
% If compare the product settings, with the accumulator settings:
get(h,'ProductWordLength')
%%
get(h,'ProductFracLength')
%%
get(h,'AccumWordLength')
%%
get(h,'AccumFracLength')

%%
% We notice that the accumulator has 8 extra bits available. This is
% typical of most fixed-point DSP processors. These bits are usually
% referred to as guard bits. They provide a safety net for intermediate
% overflows. The easiest way of appreciating their value is to remove them
% and see what happens (we adjust the output setting accordingly),
set(h,'AccumMode','SpecifyPrecision');
set(h,'AccumWordLength',get(h,'ProductWordLength'));
set(h,'OutputWordLength',get(h,'AccumWordLength'));
y = filter(h,xin);
norm(double(y)-ydouble)     % total error
%%
norm(double(y)-ydouble,inf) % max deviation
%%
plot([ydouble,double(y)])
xlabel('Samples'); ylabel('Amplitude')
legend('ydouble','y')
set(gcf, 'Color', [1 1 1])

%%
% The error is large now, because overflow occurred as can be seen in the
% plot. Notice that we still have the output settings equal to the
% accumulator settings. So the overflow is occurring in the accumulator
% itself.

%% Avoiding Overflow with No Guard Bits
% It is possible to not have overflow even if guard bits are not available.
% The easiest way to do this is to use the keep the most-significant bit
% (MSB) setting for the accumulator
set(h,'AccumMode','KeepMSB');
set(h,'OutputFracLength',get(h,'AccumFracLength'));
y = filter(h,xin);
norm(double(y)-ydouble)     % total error
%%
norm(double(y)-ydouble,inf) % max deviation

%%
% But this is a conservative mode, once again for any input. The error
% seems small because there is no output quantization error in this case.
% If we use 16 bits for the output, the error is much larger.
set(h,'OutputWordLength',16);
set(h,'OutputMode','BestPrecision');
y = filter(h,xin);
norm(double(y)-ydouble)     % total error
%%
norm(double(y)-ydouble,inf) % max deviation

%%
% From the plots of y and ydouble, it was clear that one extra bit was all
% that was required in this specific case to avoid overflow. We can improve
% the results slightly with this setting, but this is specific to the
% current filter coefficients and input signal.
set(h,'AccumMode','SpecifyPrecision');
set(h,'AccumFracLength',31);
y = filter(h,xin);
norm(double(y)-ydouble)     % total error
%%
norm(double(y)-ydouble,inf) % max deviation

%%
% The errors are the same as when we used 40 bits for the accumulator and
% 2^(-32) to scale the LSB. This indicates that the errors are due solely
% to quantization between the accumulator and the output.
