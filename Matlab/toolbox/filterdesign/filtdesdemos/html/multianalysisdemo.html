      <h2>Analysis of Single-Stage Multirate Filters<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>The analysis of single-stage multirate filters is performed at the rate the filter is operating. For decimators, the rate
         is equal to the input rate. For interpolators, the rate is equal to the output rate. For sample-rate converters, the rate
         of the filter is equal to the input rate multiplied by the interpolation factor. If a sampling frequency is given, it assumed
         that is the sampling frequency at which the filter is operating. The following plot overlays the magnitude response of a sample-rate
         converter, an interpolator, and a decimator. For the first filter, the input sampling frequency is 1000/4 and the output sampling
         frequency is 1000/3. For the interpolator, the input Fs is 1000/4 and the output Fs is 1000. Finally, for the decimator, the
         input Fs is 1000 and the output Fs is 1000/3.

      <p>All interpolators and decimators exhibit a lowpass response. The simplest interpolators, like the CIC interpolator and the
         hold interpolator have a poor lowpass response. However, they are easy to implement and do not require any multiplications
         to be performed in real-time. The following plot compares the lowpass response of four different interpolators. All of them
         have an interpolation factor of 4. One can easily see the difference in the quality of the lowpass filter, depending on which
         type of interpolator is used. The CIC interpolator has more gain than the other interpolators. For analysis purposes, we include
         a scalar in cascade with the CIC filter to normalize its gain.

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="multianalysisdemo_02.png"> <h2>Multistage Analysis<a name="3"></a></h2>
      <p>Analysis of multistage filters is possible for multistage filters of the following form:</p>
      <p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="multistage.png"> </p>
      <p>Any of the blue, red, or green sections is optional. So one can perform analysis on a multistage interpolator, a multistage
         decimator, or a multistage sample-rate converter.
      </p>
      <p>In performing the analysis, an equivalent overall filter is computed for the interpolation section and/or the decimation section
         as follows:
      </p>
      <p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="equivmultistage.png"> </p>
      <p>Where L = Lo*L1*L2*...*Lm;</p>
      <p>M = Mo*M1*M2*...*Mn;</p>
      <p>H(z)= H1(z^(Lo*L1*...<b>Lm))*H2(z^(Lo*L2</b>...<b>Lm))</b>...Hm(z^(Lo)); and
      </p>
      <p>G(z)= G1(z^(Mo*M1*...<b>Mn))*G2(z^(Mo*M2</b>...<b>Mn))</b>...Gn(z^(Mo))
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the filters H(z), G(z), and Ho(z) are all operating at the same rate and can be combined into a single filter on
         which the analysis is performed. If a sampling frequency is specified, it is assumed that this single overall filter is operating
         at that rate.
      </p>
      <h2>Multistage Interpolator Analysis<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <p>We now present an example of the analysis of a multistage interpolator. See <a href="gsmddc.html">Design of a Digital Down-Converter for GSM</a> for an example of a multistage decimator used for GSM.
      </p>
      <p>We will cascade four interpolators to form a four-stage filter. The last interpolator will be a CIC filter. In this case,
         the sampling frequency specified corresponds to the output of the four-stage interpolator because this is the rate at which
         the equivalent filter is operating.

      <p>In addition to the multistage filter shown, analysis of a multistage filter where decimation occurs prior to interpolation
         is possible provided the overall interpolation and decimation factors are the same. Notice that this does not necessarily
         mean that there is an equal number of decimation and interpolation stages.

      <p>In this case, two equivalent filters are found:</p>
      <p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="equivmultistage2.png"> </p>
      <p>Because the overall interpolation factor L is equal to the overall decimation factor M, both equivalent filters are operating
         at the same rate. If a sampling frequency is specified, it is assumed to be the rate at which both filters are operating.
         This would also be equal to the input and output rate for this case.

%% Multistage Analysis
% Analysis of multistage filters is possible for multistage filters of the
% following form:
%
% <<multistage.png>>
%
% Any of the blue, red, or green sections is optional. So one can perform
% analysis on a multistage interpolator, a multistage decimator, or a
% multistage sample-rate converter.

%%
% In performing the analysis, an equivalent overall filter is computed for
% the interpolation section and/or the decimation section as follows:
%
% <<equivmultistage.png>>
%
% Where L = Lo*L1*L2*...*Lm; 
%
% M = Mo*M1*M2*...*Mn; 
%
% H(z)= H1(z^(Lo*L1*...*Lm))*H2(z^(Lo*L2*...*Lm))*...Hm(z^(Lo)); and
%
% G(z)= G1(z^(Mo*M1*...*Mn))*G2(z^(Mo*M2*...*Mn))*...Gn(z^(Mo))
%
% Finally, the filters H(z), G(z), and Ho(z) are all operating at the same
% rate and can be combined into a single filter on which the analysis is
% performed. If a sampling frequency is specified, it is assumed that this
% single overall filter is operating at that rate.

%% Multistage Interpolator Analysis
% We now present an example of the analysis of a multistage interpolator.
% See <gsmddc.html Design of a Digital Down-Converter for GSM> for an
% example of a multistage decimator used for GSM.
%
% We will cascade four interpolators to form a four-stage filter. The last
% interpolator will be a CIC filter. In this case, the sampling frequency
% specified corresponds to the output of the four-stage interpolator
% because this is the rate at which the equivalent filter is operating.

h(1) = mfilt.firinterp(4);
h(2) = mfilt.firinterp(2);
h(3) = mfilt.firinterp(2);
h(4) = mfilt.cicinterp(16);
Hc = cascade(h);
% Compute frequency response between 0 and 200 Hz. Fs = 1000 Hz
[Hf,f] = freqz(Hc,0:1e-2:20,1000); 
plot(f,20*log10(abs(Hf)))
grid on; title('Magnitude Response');
xlabel('Frequency (Hz)'); ylabel('Magnitude (dB)');
set(gcf, 'Color', [1 1 1])

%% Multistage Sample-Rate Converter Analysis
% We now add some decimation stages to form a multistage sample-rate
% converter. The sampling frequency specified once again corresponds to the
% rate of the equivalent filter. This is the fastest rate in the entire
% system in this case.

h(5) = mfilt.firsrc(2,3);
h(6) = mfilt.cicdecim(13);
h(7) = mfilt.firdecim(5);
Hc2 = cascade(h);
% Compute frequency response between 0 and 200 Hz. Fs = 1000 Hz
[Hf,f] = freqz(Hc2,0:1e-2:20,1000); 
plot(f,20*log10(abs(Hf)))
grid on; title('Magnitude Response');
xlabel('Frequency (Hz)'); ylabel('Magnitude (dB)');
set(gcf, 'Color', [1 1 1])

%% Analysis of Other Multistage Configurations
% In addition to the multistage filter shown, analysis of a multistage
% filter where decimation occurs prior to interpolation is possible
% provided the overall interpolation and decimation factors are the same.
% Notice that this does not necessarily mean that there is an equal number
% of decimation and interpolation stages.
%
% The multistage structure that can be analyzed is as follows:
%
% <<multistage2.png>>
%

%%
% In this case, two equivalent filters are found:
%
% <<equivmultistage2.png>>
%
% Because the overall interpolation factor L is equal to the overall
% decimation factor M, both equivalent filters are operating at the same
% rate. If a sampling frequency is specified, it is assumed to be the rate
% at which both filters are operating. This would also be equal to the
% input and output rate for this case.
