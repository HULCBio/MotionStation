      <h1>Adaptive Noise Cancelling (ANC) applied to Fetal Electrocardiography.</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>This demonstration illustrates the application of adaptive filters to noise removal using adaptive noise cancelling.  In adaptive
            noise cancelling, a measured signal d(n) contains two signals:        - an unknown signal of interest v(n)        - an interference
            signal u(n) The goal is to remove the interference signal from the measured signal by using a reference signal x(n) that is
            highly correlated with the interference signal.  The example considered here is an application of adaptive filters to fetal
            electrocardiography, in which a maternal heartbeat signal is adaptively removed from a fetal heartbeat sensor signal.  This
            example is adapted from Widrow, et al, "Adaptive noise cancelling:  Principles and applications," Proc. IEEE, vol. 63, no.

      <p>In this example, we shall simulate the shapes of the electrocardiogram for both the mother and fetus.  The following commands
         create an electrocardiogram signal that a mother's heart might produce assuming a 4000 Hz sampling rate.  The heart rate for
         this signal is approximately 89 beats per minute, and the peak voltage of the signal is 3.5 millivolts.

      <p>The heart of a fetus beats noticeably faster than that of its mother, with rates ranging from 120 to 160 beats per minute.
          The amplitude of of the fetal electrocardiogram is also much weaker than that of the maternal electrocardiogram.  The following
