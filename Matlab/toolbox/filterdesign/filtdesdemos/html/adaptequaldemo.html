      <h1>Equalization in Digital Communications</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>This demonstration illustrates the application of adaptive filters to channel equalization in digital communications.  Channel
            equalization is a simple way of mitigating the detrimental effects caused by a frequency-selective and/or dispersive communication
            link between sender and receiver.  For this demonstration, all signals are assumed to have a digital baseband representation.
            During the training phase of channel equalization, a digital signal s[n] that is known to both the transmitter and receiver
            is sent by the transmitter to the receiver. The received signal x[n] contains two signals:        the signal s[n] filtered
            by the channel impulse response, and        an unknown broadband noise signal v[n]. The goal is to filter x[n] to remove the
            inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by the dispersive channel and to minimize the effect of the additive noise v[n].  Ideally,
            the output signal would closely follow a delayed version of the transmitted signal s[n].
