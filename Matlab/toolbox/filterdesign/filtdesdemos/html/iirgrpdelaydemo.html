      <h1>IIR Filter Design Given a Prescribed Group-Delay</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>This demo shows some of the key features of the IIRGRPDELAY function. This function uses a least-Pth constrained optimization
            algorithm to design allpass IIR filters that meet a prescribed group-delay.
         </p>
         <p>This function is intended to be used for group-delay equalization.</p>

      <h2>IIRGRPDELAY Syntax<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>The syntax of the IIRGRPDELAY function is very similar to that of IIRLPNORM and IIRLPNORMC (see the Least Pth-norm optimal
         IIR Filter Design demo and Constrained Least Pth-norm IIR Filter Design demo for details).
      </p>
      <p>The difference is that instead of specifying a desired magnitude response, you specify a desired group-delay response. The
         filter that is designed is an allpass filter (so its numerator is the reversed version of its denominator), therefore it is
         not possible to specify a different numerator and denominator order in this function.
      </p>
      <p>The desired group-delay is specified in a relative sense. The actual group-delay depends on the filter order (the higher the
         order, the more the delay). But if you substract the offset in the group-delay due to the filter order, the group-delay of
         the designed filter tends to match the desired group-delay. Here's and example for two different filter orders

      <p>The primary use of IIRGRPDELAY is to compensate for nonlinear-phase responses of IIR filters. Since the compensating filter
         is allpass, it can be cascaded with the filter you want to compensate without affecting its magnitude response. Since the
         cascade of the two filters is an IIR filter itself, it cannot have linear-phase (while being stable). However, it is possible
         to have approximately linear-phase response in the passband of the overall filter.
