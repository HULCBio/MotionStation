      <h1>FIR Halfband Filter Design</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>This demo showcases the FIRHALFBAND function that designs FIR halfband filters. Halfband filters are widely used in multirate
            signal processing applications when interpolating/decimating by a factor of two. Halfband filters are implemented efficiently
            in polyphase form, because approximately half of its coefficients are equal to zero.
         </p>
         <p>Halfband filters have two important characteristics, the passband and stopband ripples must be the same, and the passband-edge
            and stopband-edge frequencies are equidistant from the halfband frequency pi/2.
         </p>
         <p>FIRHALFBAND also supports designs of minimum-phase filters. Minimum-phase designs are useful for perfect reconstruction 2
            channel FIR filter banks.

      <h2>FIRHALFBAND Syntax<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>FIRHALFBAND allows for different ways of specifying design parameters in order to obtain halfband FIR filters. Two basic designs
         are available: equiripple designs and windowed-impulse-response designs. Equiripple designs can most easily be obtained from
         b = firhalfband(N,fp) where N is the filter order (which must be even and further satisfy the requirement that N/2 be odd)
         and fp is the passband-edge frequency which must be less than 1/2. For example
      </p><pre class="codeinput">N = 90;                 <span class="comment">% Filter order, N/2 is odd</span>
fp = 0.45;              <span class="comment">% Passband-edge, &lt; 1/2</span>
b = firhalfband(N,fp);  <span class="comment">% Results in an equiripple design</span>

<span class="comment">% One can verify that the passband/stopband ripples are the same</span>
hfvt = fvtool(b, <span class="string">'MagnitudeDisplay'</span>, <span class="string">'Zero-phase'</span>);
set(hfvt, <span class="string">'Color'</span>, [1 1 1])

      <p>There are two degrees of freedom for equiripple designs of halfband filters. We have already shown design in which the order
         and the passband-edge frequency are specified. The passband/stopband ripple are always the same for halfband filters. The
         syntax shown so far does not provide control over this ripple. Alternatively, one can specify the order and the passband/stopband
         ripple (deviation from ideal values) by using the 'dev' string. For this case, the passband-/stopband-edge frequencies cannot
         be specified, rather they depend on both the order and ripples specified. For example,
      </p><pre class="codeinput">N  = 102;

         a filter of minimum-order that meets the design specifications is obtained:

%% FIRHALFBAND Syntax
% FIRHALFBAND allows for different ways of specifying design parameters in
% order to obtain halfband FIR filters. Two basic designs are available:
% equiripple designs and windowed-impulse-response designs. Equiripple
% designs can most easily be obtained from b = firhalfband(N,fp) where N is
% the filter order (which must be even and further satisfy the requirement
% that N/2 be odd) and fp is the passband-edge frequency which must be less
% than 1/2. For example

N = 90;                 % Filter order, N/2 is odd
fp = 0.45;              % Passband-edge, < 1/2
b = firhalfband(N,fp);  % Results in an equiripple design

% One can verify that the passband/stopband ripples are the same
hfvt = fvtool(b, 'MagnitudeDisplay', 'Zero-phase');
set(hfvt, 'Color', [1 1 1])
%%

% Impulse response showing every other coefficient equal to zero (except
% for the middle one)
set(hfvt, 'Analysis', 'impulse');

%%
% Windowed-impulse-response designs are obtained by simply specifying the
% order and a window of appropriate length. In this case, the passband-edge
% frequency cannot be specified, rather it is a result of both the order
% and the window specified.

N  = 98;
w  = hamming(N+1);
b  = firhalfband(N,w);      % Window design
Hm = mfilt.firinterp(2,b);  % Interpolation by two filter

% One can verify that the passband/stopband ripples are the same
set(hfvt, 'Filter', Hm, 'Analysis', 'magnitude');

%%

% Impulse response still zero for every other coefficient
set(hfvt, 'Analysis', 'impulse');

%% Other Equiripple Designs
% There are two degrees of freedom for equiripple designs of halfband
% filters. We have already shown design in which the order and the
% passband-edge frequency are specified. The passband/stopband ripple are
% always the same for halfband filters. The syntax shown so far does not
% provide control over this ripple.
% Alternatively, one can specify the order and the passband/stopband ripple
% (deviation from ideal values) by using the 'dev' string. For this case,
% the passband-/stopband-edge frequencies cannot be specified, rather they
% depend on both the order and ripples specified. For example,

N  = 102;
d  = 0.001;                   % 60 dB of attenuation in the stopband
b  = firhalfband(N,d,'dev');  % Equiripple 
Hm = mfilt.firdecim(2,b);     % Decimation by two filter

% 60 dB is satisfied
set(hfvt, 'Filter', Hm, 'Analysis', 'magnitude', 'MagnitudeDisplay', 'Magnitude (dB)');

%%

% Passband-/stopband-edge frequencies are a result of design
set(hfvt, 'MagnitudeDisplay', 'Zero-phase');

%%

% Impulse response still zero for every other coefficient
set(hfvt, 'Analysis', 'impulse');

%%
% A third way of designing equiripple halfband filters is by specifying
% both the passband-edge frequency and the passband/stopband ripple. The
% order of the filter cannot be specified in this case (because there are
% only two degrees of freedom), instead a filter of minimum-order that
% meets the design specifications is obtained:

fp = 0.48;
d = 0.01;                          % 40 dB of attenuation in the stopband
b = firhalfband('minorder',fp,d);  % Equiripple 

% 40 dB is satisfied
set(hfvt, 'Filter', dfilt.dffir(b), 'Analysis', 'magnitude', 'MagnitudeDisplay', 'Magnitude (dB)');

%% Minimum-Order Kaiser Window Designs
% It is also possible to obtain minimum-order designs that meet both a
% passband-edge specification and a maximum passband/stopband ripple
% specification by using the Kaiser window. For example:

fp = 0.47;
d = 0.0001;                                 % 80 dB of attenuation in the stopband
b = firhalfband('minorder',fp,d,'kaiser');  % Kaiser-window design 

% 80 dB is satisfied
set(hfvt, 'Filter', dfilt.dffir(b));


%% Highpass Halfband Filters
% By default, all designs are lowpass. However a highpass halfband filter
% can easily be obtained by specifying a trailing 'high' string. 

fo = 0.46;  % In this case this is stopband-edge frequency
d = 0.001;  % 60 dB of attenuation in the stopband
b = firhalfband('minorder',fp,d,'kaiser','high'); % Kaiser-window design 

% Highpass filter
set(hfvt, 'Filter', dfilt.dffir(b));

%% Minimum-Phase Designs
% Minimum-phase designs are useful for 2 channel filter banks with perfect
% reconstruction composed solely of FIR filters. For this case, the
% minimum-phase filter is not in itself a halfband filter. Rather, it is a
% spectral factor of a halfband filter. The corresponding halfband filter
% can be obtained by convolving the impulse response with a reversed
% version of it (the maximum-phase spectral factor).

N = 51;     % Minimum-phase halfband filters must be of odd order
fp = 0.48;
d = 0.001;  % Stopband ripple (passband ripple is different in this case)
b1 = firhalfband(N,fp,'minphase');
b2 = firhalfband(N,d,'dev','minphase');
b3 = firhalfband('minorder',fp,d,'minphase');
