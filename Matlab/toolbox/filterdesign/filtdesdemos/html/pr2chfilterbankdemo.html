      <h1>Perfect Reconstruction Two-channel Filter Bank</h1>
      <introduction>
         <p>Often in digital signal processing the need arises to decompose signals into low and high frequency bands, after which need
            to be combined to reconstruct the original signal.  Such an example is found in subband coding (SBC). This demo shows an example
            of perfect reconstruction of a two-channel filter bank, also known as the Quadrature Mirror Filter (QMF) Bank since it uses
            power complementary filters.  We will simulate our perfect reconstruction process by filtering a signal made up of Kronecker
            deltas. Plots of the input, output, and error signal will be provided, as well as the magnitude spectra of the signals. The
            mean-square error will also be computed to measure the effectiveness of the perfect reconstruction filter bank.

      <h2>Perfect Reconstruction<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>Perfect reconstruction is a process by which a signal is completely recovered after being separated into its low frequencies
         and high frequencies. Below is a block diagram of a perfect reconstruction process which uses ideal filters.  The perfect
         reconstruction process requires four filters, two lowpass filters (H0 and G0) and two highpass filters (H1 and G1). In addition,
         it requires a downsampler and upsampler between the two lowpass and between the two highpass filters. Note that we have to
         account for the fact that our output filters need to have a gain of two to compensate for the preceding upsampler.

      <h2>Perfect Reconstruction Two-Channel Filter Bank<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>The Filter Design Toolbox provides a specialized function, called FIRPR2CHFB, to design the four filters required to implement
         an FIR perfect reconstruction two-channel filter bank as described above. FIRPR2CHFB designs the four FIR filters for the
         analysis (H0 and H1) and synthesis (G0 and G1) sections of a two-channel perfect reconstruction filter bank. The design corresponds
         to so-called orthogonal filter banks also known as power-symmetric filter banks, which are required in order to achieve the
         perfect reconstruction.
      </p>
      <p>Let's design a filter bank with filters of order 99 and passband edges of the lowpass and highpass filters of 0.45 and 0.55,
         respectively:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">N = 99;
[H0,H1,G0,G1] = firpr2chfb(N,.45);
</pre><p>Note that the analysis path consists of a filter followed by a downsampler, which is a decimator, and the synthesis path consists
         of an upsampler followed by a filter, which is an interpolator. So, we can use the multirate filter objects available in the
         Filter Design Toolbox to implement our analysis and synthesis filter bank by using a decimator followed by an interpolator,
         respectively.
