%ZPLANE Instantaneous adaptive filter Z-plane pole-zero plot.
%   ZPLANE(Hd) plots the zeros and poles of the adaptive filter Hd
%   with the unit circle as reference in the Filter Visualization Tool
%   (FVTool).  Each zero is represented with a 'o' and each pole with a 'x'
%   on the plot.  Multiple zeros and poles are indicated by the
