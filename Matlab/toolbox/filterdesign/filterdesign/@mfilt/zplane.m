%ZPLANE Multirate filter Z-plane pole-zero plot.
%   ZPLANE(Hm) plots the zeros and poles of the multirate filter Hm
%   with the unit circle for reference in the Filter Visualization Tool
%   (FVTool).  Each zero is represented with a 'o' and each pole with a 'x'
%   on the plot.  Multiple zeros and poles are indicated by the
%   multiplicity number shown to the upper right of the zero or pole.
