*       Computes a real FIR filter (direct-form) using coefficients         *
*       stored in vector h.  The real data input is stored in vector x.     *
*       The filter output result is stored in vector r.  Input data and     *
*       filter taps are 16-bit, with intermediate values kept at 32-bit     *
*       precision.  Filter taps are expected in Q15 format.                 *
*                                                                           *

*       1.  Load double word instruction is used to simultaneously load     *
*           four values in a single clock cycle.                            *
