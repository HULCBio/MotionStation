<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Real-Time Controller</p>
<p>This demonstration shows how to build a simple closed-loop real-time controller
using the Real-Time Windows Target. The output of the controlled plant is connected
to the analog input of your data acquisition board. This signal is subtracted from
the set point value generated by the signal generator and processed by a PID
controller. The output of the controller drives the input of the plant using the
analog output of your data acquisition board.
</p>
<p>This model is a simplified version of the controller used for the
<a href="http://www.humusoft.com/models/ce152.htm">CE152 Magnetic Levitation Model</a>.
</p>

<p>
<h3>How to run this demo:</h3>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <b>Analog Input</b> and <b>Analog Output</b> blocks and select your
data acquisition board.<br>If there's no board installed, install it using the
<b>Install new board</b> button.
<li>Build the model using <b>Tools</b> -> <b>Real-Time Workshop</b> -> <b>Build Model</b>.
<li>Connect to the real-time code using <b>Simulation</b> -> <b>Connect to target</b>.
<li> Start the real-time execution using <b>Simulation</b> -> <b>Start real-time code</b>.
</ol>

<p><em>Note: To run this demo, you must have have a data acquisition board plugged into
your computer.</em></p>
