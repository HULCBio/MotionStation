<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Real-Time Filter</p>
<p>This is an example of real-time filter built using the Signal Processing Blockset
and Real-Time Windows Target. The unfiltered signal is acquired by the analog
input, passed through a filter designed by the Signal Processing Blockset and finally sent
to analog output. Both the unfiltered and filtered signals are shown in real-time
using the Scope block.</p>

<p>
<h3>How to run this demo:</h3>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <b>Analog Input</b> and <b>Analog Output</b> blocks and select your
data acquisition board.<br>If there's no board installed, install it using the
<b>Install new board</b> button.
<li>Build the model using <b>Tools</b> -> <b>Real-Time Workshop</b> -> <b>Build Model</b>.
<li>Connect to the real-time code using <b>Simulation</b> -> <b>Connect to target</b>.
<li> Start the real-time execution using <b>Simulation</b> -> <b>Start real-time code</b>.
</ol>

<p><em>Note: To run this demo, you must have have a data acquisition board plugged into
your computer.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: This demo requires the Signal Processing Blockset.</em></p>
