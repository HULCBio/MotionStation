<p>
Real-Time Windows Target enables you to run Simulink and Stateflow models
in real time on your desktop or laptop PC. You can create and control a real-time
execution entirely through Simulink. Using Real-Time Workshop, you generate C code,
compile it, and start real-time execution on Microsoft Windows while interfacing
to real hardware using PC I/O boards. You use the same computer for building the
model in Simulink and as a real-time target platform. Other Windows applications continue
to run during real-time operation and can use all CPU cycles not needed by the real-time task.
Typical applications for the Real-Time Windows Target include real-time control,
signal processing, rapid prototyping and hardware-in-the-loop simulations.
