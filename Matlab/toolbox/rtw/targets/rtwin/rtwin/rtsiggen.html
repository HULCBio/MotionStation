<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Real-Time Signal Generator</p>
<p>This demonstration shows how to produce an analog output signal
using the Real-Time Windows Target. Because analog output typically requires
less configuration and is easier to connect than analog input, this demo
is a good start to your experiments with data acquisition boards. You can
verify the presence of the generated signal e.g. by connecting an oscilloscope
to the analog output pins of your data acquisition board.
</p>

<p>
<h3>How to run this demo:</h3>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <b>Analog Output</b> block and select your data acquisition board.<br>
If there's no board installed, install it using the <b>Install new board</b> button.
<li>Build the model using <b>Tools</b> -> <b>Real-Time Workshop</b> -> <b>Build Model</b>.
<li>Connect to the real-time code using <b>Simulation</b> -> <b>Connect to target</b>.
<li> Start the real-time execution using <b>Simulation</b> -> <b>Start real-time code</b>.
</ol>

<p><em>Note: To run this demo, you must have have a data acquisition board plugged into
your computer.</em></p>
