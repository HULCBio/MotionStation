Maximum <a href="#task_turnaround_time">task turnaround time</a> for each task
since model execution started. Note that the maximum task turnaround time that can be
measured is limited by the timer measurement range; this may affect the results,
in particular, if the timer word-size is only 8 or 16 bits and if the sub-rate
sample times are much longer than the base sample time.

<p><a name="task_turnaround_time"></a><b>Task turnaround time</b> is the elapsed time
between start and finish of the task. If the task is not pre-empted then the
task turnaround time is equal to the task execution time.

<p><a name="task_execution_time"></a><b>Task execution time</b> is that part of the
time between task start and finish when the task is actually running and not pre-empted by another task.

  <p><a name="task_overruns"></a><b>Task overruns</b> occur when a timer task does
  not complete before that same task is next scheduled to run. Depending on how
  the real-time scheduler is configured, a task overrun may be handled as a
  real-time failure. Alternatively, a small number of task overruns may be allowed
  in order to accommodate cases where a task occasionally takes longer than
normal to complete.
