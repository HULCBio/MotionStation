<h3><a name=OVERVIEW><span style='color:#990000'>Real-Time Workshop and Embedded Coder Overview</span></a></h2>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>The MathWorks model-based
design approach makes all phases of the embedded system development process
easier -- from concept through deployment. Simulink and Stateflow provide fine grain
software design capabilities and bit-accurate simulation to let you develop
executable software specification models. MathWorks native automatic code
generation technologies preserve your model&#8217;s executable behavior and let
you move smoothly through simulation, prototyping, implementation, testing, and
finally into production. Real-Time Workshop and Stateflow Coder provide the
foundational code generation capabilities for applications such as rapid
prototyping, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, and host-based simulation
acceleration. Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder extends these capabilities with
advanced features for memory optimization, data typing, verification, and
deployment on production systems. </p>

<h3><a name="RTW_FEATURES"><span style='color:#990000'>Real-Time Workshop Feature Summary</span></a></h3>

<p>Real-Time Workshop is the code generator for Simulink. It
provides the quickest method to explore and test new concepts and designs by
using automatically generated ANSI-C code. Real-Time Workshop is a popular and
proven solution for system designers who require rapid prototyping,
hardware-in-the-loop simulation, stand-alone (real or non real-time)
simulation, or generic algorithm export capability. In these phases of the
design process, developers require robust analysis, testing, and debugging
capabilities. Considerations that are directly related to the embedded software
development phase such as memory optimization, code configuration and
packaging, component testing, and code traceability are provided by the
Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder.</p>

<h3><a name="RTWEC_FEATURES"><span style='color:#990000'>Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder Feature Summary</span></a></h3>

<p>Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder generates optimized ANSI-C
or ISO-C code for fixed point and floating point microprocessors. It extends the
capabilities provided by the Real-Time Workshop to support specification,
integration, deployment, and testing of production applications on embedded
targets. Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder addresses targeting considerations
such as RAM, ROM, and CPU constraints, code configuration, and code validation.
</p>

<p>The Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder supports all the
Real-Time Workshop features listed above plus it adds: </p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>Simplified calling interfaces that reduce overhead and let you easily
     incorporate the generated code into hand-written (legacy) application code. </li>
 <li>Streamlined data structures, reducing RAM requirements. </li>
 <li>Configuration options to communicate data to your application code via
     function arguments or global data structures. </li>
 <li>Auto generation of an example main program detailing precisely how to
     deploy the code generated for a model with or without an operating system.</li>
 <li>Comprehensive APIs that let you customize the generate code specific to
     your environment.</li>
 <li>Extensive code configuration options to provide control over
     the structure, layout and format of the generated data and functions.</li>
 <li>User-defined comments for Simulink and Stateflow objects to transfer your
     requirements into the code and improve code readability and traceability,
     including intrinsic support for Simulink Verification and Validation.</li>
 <li>Rate grouping of mixed sample times systems into separate functions to
     optimize and simplify code deployment. </li>
 <li>Single- and multi-instance code generation; both using static memory
     allocation. </li>
 <li>Support for user-defined alias and numeric data types.</li>
 <li>Persistent identifier names with precise control over the naming to
     minimize code differences between model revisions.</li>

 <li>Combined output and update functions for atomic systems, significantly
     reducing RAM and ROM requirements. </li>
 <li>Configuration options to optimize data initialization, reducing ROM requirements.</li>
 <li>Configuration options to optimize fixed-point operations.</li>
 <li>Detailed HTML report to fully document the generated code and link code
     segments back to the model, making the code extremely readable and traceable. </li>
 <li>Software-in-the-loop code verification to test the generated code on the host
     system in a closed-loop simulation inside Simulink. </li>
 <li>Custom storage classes give
     you precise control over the symbolic representation of data. This lets
     you easily interface data used by the generated code to virtually any
     class of structured or unstructured data required by your existing code
     base. </li>

<h3><a name="RTW_TARGETS"><span style='color:#990000'>Real-Time Workshop Targets</span></a></h3>

<p>A Real-Time Workshop target specifies the overall framework
of the generated code, determines its style, and enables options.  Depending on
your application's goal, you can select one of several targets. The two most popular
targets are the Generic Real-Time (GRT) and Embedded Real-Time (ERT) targets.
GRT exposes the features of Real-Time Workshop.  ERT, a superset of GRT,
exposes the combined features of Real-Time Workshop and Real-Time Workshop
Embedded Coder.</p>

<p>The S-Function (RTWSFCN) target is for converting models
into Simulink S-Function DLLs.  This
allows you to share models without compromising intellectual property.
The Generic Real-Time Malloc (GRT-Malloc) target is a
slight variant of GRT that adds dynamic memory allocation to GRT.</p>

<p>Custom targets, such as xPC Target, are achieved
via target derivation.  A Real-Time
Workshop license is required if you use or derive from the GRT, GRT-Malloc,
and RTWSFCN target.  An additional Real-Time Workshop
Embedded Coder license is required if you use or derive from the ERT target.
The Embedded Target for Motorola MPC555, for example, derives from the ERT
target and thus requires a Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder license.</p>

<p>The ERT target contains a <b><i>very important</i></b> option &#8220;GRT
compatible call interface.&#8221;  Effectively, this ERT option allows you
to create a single target that works seamlessly with or without a Real-Time
Workshop Embedded Coder license.</p>

<h3><a name="EMBEDDED_TARGETS"></a><span style='color:#990000'>Embedded Targets </span></h3>

<p>Embedded target products let you deploy production
code generated from Real-Time Workshop Embedded Coder directly onto
microprocessor families. You use embedded targets to execute code in real-time
on microcontrollers and DSPs for on-target rapid
prototyping or production deployment of embedded applications. Each embedded
target offers unique features and capabilities including, device driver blocks,
target memory reporting and execution profiling, and integrations with
third-party compilers and debuggers. </p>

<p>Embedded target products currently available include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Embedded Target for Motorola<sup>&reg;</sup> MPC555</li>
<li>Embedded Target for Motorola<sup>&reg;</sup> HC12</li>
<li>Embedded Target for OSEK/VDX<sup>&reg;</sup></li>
<li>Embedded Target for Infineon C166<sup>&reg;</sup> Microcontrollers -- includes
ST Microelectronics ST10 family</li>
<li>Embedded Target for TI C2000<sup>&#8482;</sup> DSP</li>
<li>Embedded Target for TI C6000<sup>&#8482;</sup> DSP</li>
</ul> 

<p> You can also create your own custom targets similar to these products
using the comprehensive APIs provided by Real-Time Workshop and Real-Time
Workshop Embedded Coder.

<h3><a name="RSIM_TARGET"></a><span style='color:#990000'>Rapid Simulation Target</span></h3>

<p>The Rapid Simulation (RSim) Target generates
extremely fast, standalone simulations for models using variable or fixed-step
solvers. RSim supports modification of input signal
data and model parameters by reading data from a MAT-File, without recompiling
the generated code. This is particularly useful for &quot;batch&quot; and Monte
Carlo simulation runs. </p>

<p>RSim is included with Real-Time Workshop. </p>
