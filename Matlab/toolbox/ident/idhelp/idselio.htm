<title>Help: Select Channels</title>
The Select Channel dialog is opened by chosing the corresponding item in the pop-up menu Preprocessing in the ident window.<p>
You can create a new data set from the Working Data set by selecting a subset of its inputs and outputs.<p>

Enter the selected input and output numbers in the respective edit boxes. The original numbers are given by default.<p>

Enter any string in the Data name: edit box. <p>

The ident keeps track of the input and output numbers.  Thus if a certain output was y3 in the original data set it will be labeled as such in all views for any reduced data sets and models derived from it. This facilitates comparisons of different models.<p>

Press the Revert button to restore the data set's original input-output channels.
