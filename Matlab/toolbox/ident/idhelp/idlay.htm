<title> Layout and Preferences </title>
The graphical user interface is governed by a number of options and
defaults. This includes colors, window sizes, axes sizes, default status of
checkmenus etc. <p>

During a session, windows can be moved and resized at will. They 
can be closed and reopened keeping their sizes and positions.
(If you, however, close a window using the window manager,
it will be reopened in its default size and position.) <p>

Select <b>Save preferences</b> from the Ident window Options menu to save the 
current window layout and checkmenu status.
Next time ident is opened it will use this layout and status.
Select <b>Default preferences</b> from the Options menu to return to the default.
<p>
The information is stored in idprefs.mat. By default this is stored in the
same directory as your startup.m file. Use the command <b> midprefs</b> in the
MATLAB command window to select onother directory for this file.<p>
Advanced use:
The many options in the plot windows - as well as the default color 
ordering of the object icons and curves - are all defined in the
M-file idlayout.m. To customize these defaults, edit a copy of this
file and place it in a directory in your MATLABPATH, before the
regular ident directory.
