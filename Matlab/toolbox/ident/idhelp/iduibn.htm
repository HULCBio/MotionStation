<title>Model Structures Defined by Initial Model</title>
<center><h3>Model Structures Defined by Initial Model</h3></center>
Ident can estimate models of any structure, supported by the System Identification Toolbox. Select Paramatric Models in the pop-up menu Estimate in the ident window, and chose By Initial Model in its Model structure pop-up menu.
<p>
Enter the name of any model structure in the Initial model: edit box of the Parametric Models dialog and then press the Estimate button. The method is a standard prediction error/maximum likelihood approach that iteratively searches for the minimum of a criterion. Options that govern this search are accessed via the Options button in the <a href="iduiiter.htm">Iteration control...</a> dialog.<p>

The name of the model structure must be a variable in either the MATLAB workspace or on the Model board. In the latter case, you can just drag-and-drop the model icon over the Initial model: edit box.
<p>

Arbitrary model structures can be defined using several commands in the System Identification Toolbox:
<dl>
<dt>IDPOLY <dd>Creates input-output structures for single-output models.
<dt>IDSS   <dd>Creates linear state-space models with arbitrary, free parameters.
<dt>IDGREY  <dd>Creates completely arbitrary parametrizations of linear systems.
<dt>IDARX  <dd>Creates multi-variable ARX-structures.
<dt>SET <dd>Modifies model structures.
</dl>
See the manual for more information on these functions.
