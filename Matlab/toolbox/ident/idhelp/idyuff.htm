<center><h3>Frequency Function Data</h3></center>
The Frequency Function Data View plot is opened by checking the corresponding check box 
in the ident window.<p>
The plots show the frequency responses of selected data sets. 
For Frequency Function Data sets (IDFRD) (marked by a light brown background color) this
plot gives the amplitude and phase plots of the corresponding frequency response. For
time and frequency domain data sets, the plot shows the Empirical Transfer Function Estimate
(ETFE).<p>
The scales and units can be chosen under the Style menu.
