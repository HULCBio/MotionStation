<title>Help: Time Plot</title>
The Time Plot is opened by checking the corresponding check box in the ident window.<p>

The plots show the selected data sets. For multi-input multi-output data 
sets, the input-output pair is chosen using the Channel menu.<p>

The output is the upper plot, and the input is the lower plot. The input
is plotted so that it is piecewise constant between the sampling instants.
This can be changed to linear interpolation by selecting Regular input
from the Style menu. <P>

The time scales are consistent with the information about sampling time
and start time supplied when the data set was imported.
