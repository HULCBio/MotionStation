<center><h3>Process Models</h3></center>
The Process Models dialog is opened by chosing the corresponding 
item in the pop-up menu Estimate in the ident window.<p>
The dialog box gives access to so called Process Models,
and operates on the Working Data set in the main ident window.<p>

Process Models are simple continuous time models that are described in
terms of the main time constants, the static gain, a possible dead-time,
and a possible process zero (Non-constant numerator). Multi-input models
can be handled, and noise descriptions of certain structures can be added.<p>
A typical such model is the transfer function<p>
G(s) = K exp(-Td s)/(1+ s Tp1)

<title> Defining a Process Model</title>
<a name="usage">
<center><h3>Defining a Process Model</h3></center>
<dl>
 <dt><b>Poles </b></dt>
<dd> Select the number of poles (time constants) using the popup-menu.
<dd> Choose if they should
all be real or if possibly complex (underdamped) modes should be allowed at the popup-menu
beside.
<dt><b>Delay</b></dt>
<dd> Indicate by checking the 'Delay' box if a dead-time (time delay) should be included.
<dt><b>Integration (self-regulating process)</b></dt>
<dd>Check the 'Integrator' box to enforce an integration in the process model.
<dt><b>Zero</b></dt>
<dd>Indicate by checking the 'Zero' box if a process zero (extra numerator coefficient) 
should be included.
<dt><b>Model Name</b></dt>
<dd>
A default model name is generated online. It is built up as an acronym from the number
of poles, and whether a D(elay) an I(ntegrator) a Z(ero) are included and whether
U(nderdamped) modes are allowed. The model name can be changed by simply typing the desired
name in the corresponding box.
<dt><b>Multi-input Models</b></dt>
<dd> Use the 'Input Number' popup-menu to select input channel. Check 'Same structure for
all channels' if the chosen structure should be the same for all inputs. Otherwise,
go through all the inputs and determine the structure for each channel.
</dl>
<title>Parameter Values and Constraints</title>
<a name="parv">
<center><h4>Parameter Values and Constraints</h4></center>
 If you know certain parameters, enter their values and check them as 'known' in
the right side of the dialog window. If you have initial guesses of the parameters
enter them in the 'Value' box, but do not check the 'Known' box.
If you know bounds on the parameters enter them as min and max values.
If you do not know initial values just enter 'Auto' or leave the 
corresponding box empty. A special start-up
process will then be invoked. Generally speaking it is better to rely upon this
process than entering a bad guess.<p>
Finally press the Estimate button to perform the estimation and 
enter the resulting model into the Model board.  The estimated values of the
parameters are automatically entered in the 'Value' boxes.<P>
<center><h4>Manipulating Initial Guesses</h4></center>
By pressing the button 'Value --> Initial', the current model values are tranferred to
the initial guesses. This may be  valuable when you  want to continue the search for a
good model from the current one, either by trying more iterations (press 'Estimate' again) 
or by first modifying the structure, like adding another pole or zero.<p>
The button 'Clear Initial' clears all the initial guesses, to invoke the
special initialization routine.<p>
Note that both these buttons apply to all inputs in the multi-input case.

<dl>
<dt><b>Disturbance Model</b>
<dd> Offers the choices None, Order 1 and Order 2.
<dl>
<dt>'None'<dd>
does not provide any model of the disturbances.
<dt>'Order 1'<dd>
Estimates an additional, continuous time first order ARMA model for the additive noise:<p>
y = G u + H e<p>
where H is a first order rational filter C/D and e is white noise.
<dt>'Order 2'<dd>
Same as above, but a second order ARMA model.
</dl>
<dt><b>Focus</b>
<dd> Offers the choices Prediction, Estimation, Filter, and Stability. 
<dl>
<dt>'Prediction' <dd>gives
a standard prediction error estimation method. This has optimal statistical
properties but from an approximation point,it typically favors a model fit
 at high frequencies. 
 <dt>'Simulation' <dd>approximates the dynamics of the model
(the transfer function from measured inputs to outputs) in a norm that is given by
the input spectrum. For the noise model, a prediction error method is used, while
the dynamics model is kept constant. 
<dt>'Filter' <dd>gives an additional weighting for
the dynamics model fit, by the frequency contents of a user defined filter. When
this option is chosen, a filter dialog window opens and you can design standard
Butterworth filters that are used for the model fit.
<dt>'Stability' <dd>forces the identified model to be stable.
</dl>

<dt><b>Initial State</b>
<dd> The models require certain initial signal values to compute model outputs, the
initial state. For systems with slowly decaying responses, it may be very important
to handle these initial states in a good way. The popupmenu gives you the
following options:
<dl>
<dt>Auto</dt>
<dd> This is the default. An automatic choice between the alternatives below is
made, guided by the data properties.
<dt>Zero</dt>
<dd> All necessary initial values are taken as zero.
<dt>Estimate</dt>
<dd> The unknown intial values are treated as parameters, which are estimated.
<dt>Backcast</dt>
<dd>The initial values are estimated directly with a backwards filtering method.
</dl>
<dt><b>Covariance</b>
<dd> Covariance = 'Estimate' is the default and normal choice. The the uncertainty of the
estimated model will also be computed, and the confidence region of any <tt>Model View</tt> will also
be diplayed whan asked for in the Options menu. For large models, the handling of
uncertainty meausures may dominate the computation time.<br>
Covariance = 'None' suppresses the estimation and handling of uncertainty measures.
