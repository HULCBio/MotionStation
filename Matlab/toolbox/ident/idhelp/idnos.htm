<title>Setting Number of Samples</title>
Enter the number of samples for the transient responses to calculate.
<p>
When the  option has been changed, all the curves in the Transient response View are redrawn for the new number of samples, except those curves that correspond to correlation analysis estimates. These will always be given for the number of samples that were chosen at the time the estimate was created.
<p>
The default value is 40 samples, which can be obtained by entering the empty matrix.
