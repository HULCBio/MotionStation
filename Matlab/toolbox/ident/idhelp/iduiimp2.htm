<center><h3>Importing Time Domain Data</h3></center>

This dialog is used to enter input and output signals into the GUI and to
associate the signals with relevant information.
<p>
Enter valid MATLAB expressions in the Input: and Output: edit boxes.  The 
expressions should evaluate to either a column vector or a matrix.<p>

A valid expression is, for example, <br>
<tt>   [temp(234:500) current(234:500).^2]</tt><br>
where <tt>temp</tt> and <tt>current</tt> are column vector variables 
in the MATLAB workspace.
<p>
Optionally enter any string in the Data name: edit box. The data set 
will be labeled with the name in the ident window.  
If Starting time: and Sampling interval: information are supplied,
 the time and frequency scales of various Views will be affected accordingly.
<p>
Pressing the <b> More </b> button gives access to more properies to 
associate the data with, <p>
The channel names will follow the data, and be the basis for subselecting
channels etc. Default names are 'y1', 'y2', ... 'u1', 'u2' etc. The noise
sources will be automatically named for for the corresponding output:
'e@yname' is the name of the disturbance that is additive to the
output with name 'yname'. <p>
<p> The names are entered without quotes, separed by commas. 
The number of names must equal the number of channels.<p>
Units for the measured variables can be given, if desired. These are used
only for plot information. Enter as comma separated strings. (No quotes.) <p>
Enter any text into the   edit box at the bottom.  The notes will remain 
associated with the data and any models which are estimated from it.
<p>
Press the button Less to remove the extra page. <p>
Press Import to enter the data set into the ident Data board.
<p>
Press Reset to return all edit boxes to their default values.
<p>
If you have a variable in the workspace that is in the
IDDATA format (type HELP IDDATA) it is more efficient 
to use the Import Data Object dialog. This is opened by typing the hotkey <b>d</b> 
in the ident window or by selecting this item in the Data popupmenu.
