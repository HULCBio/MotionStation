<center><h3>Importing Data</h3></center>
Whole <a href="#sess">sessions</a> are loaded from disk using the
 <a href="idfile.htm">File menu</a> items. <p>
To import a single data set directly from the MATLAB workspace,
 there are two variants:
<ol>
<li> To create a data set from input and output signals available
 in the workspace, select 
 <dl><dt>IMPORT DATA>Time Domain data... 
 <dt>or
 IMPORT DATA>Frequency Domain data...
 </dl>
 from the Import Data pop-up menu.
 <li> If the data set already exists in the workspace as an IDDATA or IDFRD object, then
import it by selecting <dl><dt>IMPORT DATA>Data Object... </dl> 
</ol>
The Import data dialog will also be opened by
pressing the hotkey <b>d</b> 
when the pointer is in the ident window.
In either case a dialog box opens and asks for relevant information,
 such as sampling interval and time span. Notes can also be added. 
This information will follow the data set throughout.<p>

<center><h3>Importing Models</h3></center>
Whole <a href="#sess">sessions</a> are loaded from disk using the 
<a href="idfile.htm">File menu</a> items. <p>

Earlier created models in the Toolbox's IDMODEL and IDFRD formats
 can be imported
 from the MATLAB workspace using the <b>Models pop-up menu</b>.
 Also models in the Control System Toolbox's LTI model formats can be 
 directly imported.<p>

<a name="sess">
<center><h3>Ident Sessions</h3></center>
A session is the status of all data sets and all models on the
    Model/data
 board(s) including their diary and notes. A session can consist of an 
    
arbitrary number of extra boards (which can be opened under the
 <b>Options</b> menu in the main ident window.<p>

 
Sessions are opened, closed, and saved under the main ident window's 
File menu.<p>
Only one session can be open at any time. You can however merge
      another,
 previous session into the current one, using the File menu.
