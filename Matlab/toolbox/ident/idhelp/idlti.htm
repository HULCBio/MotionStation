    <title>Using the LTI Viewer with Ident</title>
This feature is available only to users with the Control System
    Toolbox.<p>

To activate the viewer, drag and drop the model icon to the box 'To LTI
    Viewer'. For information how to handle the viewer, type 'help
    ltiview' in the command window.<p>
    
    For models with an input, only the transfer functions from measured inputs to'
    outputs will be displayed in the viewer. For time-series models, the transfer
    functions from the noise sources to the outputs willbe displayed.

All models that are sent to the viewer can be examined
      simultaneously. Plots can be clicked in and out, and models can
      be deleted using the buttons of the viewer. <p>

Only models with the same number of inputs and outputs can be examined
      simultaneously. If a model of different size is added, the
      previous ones will be deleted from the viewer. <p>

The models are not exported to the workspace by examining them in the
      LTI-viewer. To <A HREF="idmw.htm#export">Export</a> the model drag its icon to the <b>To
	Workspace</b> box. It is then delivered as an IDMODEL or IDFRD 
      object. If desired, this can be converted to the LTI objects,
      simply by ss(m), tf(m), etc.
