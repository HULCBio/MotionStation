<title>General Plot Menu Items</title>
<center><h3>Plot management</h3></center>
A curve can be toggled on/off by clicking in the corresponding data/model icon.<br>
On color screens the curves are color coded along with the data/model. <br>

By pointing at a curve and clicking (shift-click or middle mouse button if Zoom is enabled) 
the curve can also be identified.<br>
For multi-input multi-output data/models the input-output pair is chosen by the menu item Channel.

<dt><b>Copy figure</b>
    <dd>Copies the plot to a new MATLAB figure, but does not copy menus and controls.
 <dt><b>Print</b>
    <dd>Opens MATLAB's Print Dialog for the current figure.
 <dt><b>Close</b>
    <dd>Closes the current window. This is equivalent to unchecking associated ident
    View check box. It is the preferred way of closing the figure. Quitting by the 
    window manager title bar will not provide feedback to the identification software.

<dl>
<dt><b>Grid</b>
    <dd>Toggles gridding.
 <dt><b>Zoom</b>
    <dd>Toggles zoom.<br>
When the Zoom function is enabled, the left and right buttons have their normal MATLAB ZOOM function:
Right: Zoom out. Left: Zoom in.  The middle button on a three button mouse has a plot specific 
identification function.  Typically, clicking the middle button associates a line with its  
data set or model.  Other functionality will be related via a status line. 
When the Zoom function is disabled, all mouse buttons perform the middle button function.
On a one- or two-button mouse, the middle button corresponds to shift-click (extend-select) <p>
If the zoom malfunctions after a data change in the plot, invoke Autorange under the 
Options menu to reset it.
 <dt><b>Separate linestyles
 <dt>All solid lines</b>
    <dd>These mutually exclusive checkmenus determine how the curves are plotted. 
    On black and white monitors, using the Separate linestyle option will help associate
    the curves with the right data/model.<p>
 When this menu item is chosen the currently visible curves will be assigned solid,
 dashed, dotted and dash-dotted linestyles.
 <dt><b>Erasemode xor
 <dt>Erasemode normal</b>
    <dd>These mutually exclusive checkmenus determine how the curves are plotted. 
    Erasemode xor means that the plot is not redrawn when a curve is clicked in and out. 
    This gives a faster response, but may give bad quality on certain color screens. 
    Erasemode normal means that the entire plot will be redrawn when a new curve is added or deleted.

<title>Channel Menu in Plot Windows</title>
<a name="channel">
<center><h3>Channel Menu Items</h3></center>
The selected checkmenu under the Channel menu determines which input-output relation is plotted.<p>
For example u1->y2 means that the transfer function from input 'u1' to output 'y2' is displayed.
The symbol e - as in e@y3->y1 - refers to a noise source. There are as many noise sources as outputs.
e@ynam refers the the innovation (noise source) for the output with name ynam.<p>
For the Model output and Noise spectrum Views, only the output name matters.<p>
The current channel names are always displayed in the figure title.<p>
The naming of the signals remains consistent among different data sets that
have been created by subselecting channels from an original set.
