<title>Help: Estimation Focus</title>
<center><h3>Estimation Focus</h3></center>
The Estimation focus dialog box is opened when the menu item
'Filter' is chosen in the pop-up list 'Focus' in the estimation dialogs.
<p>
Enter in the edit box a matrix that defines 
the filter ranges IN RAD/S that will define the passband
of the estimation focus. Several passbands can be defined by letting each
row define a separate passband.
<p>
Example 1. Enhance the fit below 5 rad/s: Enter [0 5]
<p>
Example 2. Exclude the range [1 2] rad/s from the fit: Enter [0 1;2 100]
(assuming the Nyquist frequency is 100 rad/s or less.)
<p> 
Example 3. Focus the fit to the bands [1 2] rad/s and [5 6] rad/. Enter
[1 2;5 6].

<p>
Alternatively the name of any valid focus variable (LTI object or
IDMODEL object or a frequency domain weight vector; See IDPROPS ALGORITHM) can be entered.
This variable must then exist in the workspace.
