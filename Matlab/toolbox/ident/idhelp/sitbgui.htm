<TITLE> System Identification </TITLE>
<center><h3>System Identification</h3></center>
System Identification is the art and science of building mathematical models
from measured input-output data. <p>
You will have to examine the measured data, and create new data sets from the original 
one by various preprocessing. <P>
Then you will estimate models using the data. The models are estimated within certain
classes of candidate descriptions (model structures), typically by choosing that model
that gives the best output fit to the measured data. Quite a few models are normally 
estimated, and their properties are scrutinized and analyzed in different model views.
<p><b>Ident</b> is a graphical user interface to the System Identification Toolbox, 
that helps you with these tasks. The <A HREF="idmw.htm">ident window</A> governs all
data handling, model estimation, and model analysis. The ident window also keeps a 
detailed record of all data sets and models. Data sets and models are represented as
icons in the tables of black boxes. <p>
The process of system identification using ident involves the following six steps:

  <br> <A href="idimp.htm#data">Importing</a> data into ident.
  <br> <A HREF="#dvieww">Examining</A> data. 
  <br> <A HREF="iddatprp.htm">Preprocessing</A> data.
  <br> <A HREF="idestm.htm">Estimating models</A> based on data. 
  <br> <A HREF="#mvieww">Analyzing the models</A>.
  <br> <A HREF="idmw.htm#export">Exporting</a> resulting models for further use.

<TITLE>View Windows</TITLE>
<A NAME="vieww">
<center><h3>View Windows</h3></center>
    The ident window contains two check boxes for examining Views of the selected 
    data sets <p> It contains six check boxes that allow you to examine the 
    <a href="idmw.htm#datamod">selected models</a>.<p>
To open a View, check the corresponding box. A selected data set or model is one 
whose icon has a thick line. Clicking an icon toggles its selection. 
On color screens, the views are color coded so that curves in the View windows have
the same color as their associated icons.<p>


The <a href="#dvieww">Data Views</a> give time and frequency domain plots of the
input output data.<p>
The <a href="#mvieww">Model Views</a> analyse and display several model properties.

<center><h3>Data View Windows</h3></center>
There are two views to examine data sets. These view windows are opened by checking 
the corresponding check boxes in the ident window.  Select and deselect which data sets 
to examine by clicking on their icon.<p>
<dl>
<dt> <b><A href="idplot.htm">Time Plot </A></b>
     <dd> This gives the time plots of inputs and outputs of the selected data sets.
     <dt> <b><a href="iduyspe.htm">Data spectra </A></b>
	  <dd> This gives the spectra (periodograms or estimated spactra) of inputs and 
	  outputs of the selected data sets.
	  <dt> <b><a href="idyuff.htm">Frequency functiom</A></b>
	  <dd> This gives the estimated frequency functions (estimated using ETFE for
	  time and frequency domain data) of the selected data sets.

<TITLE>Model View Windows</TITLE>
<A NAME="mvieww">
<center><h3>Model View Windows</h3></center>
For text information and access to the model parameters, <b>double-click</b> 
(right mouse button) on the model icon. For visual infomation, there are
<b>six views</b> to analyze and examine model properties. 
These view windows are opened by checking the corresponding 
check boxes in the ident window. Select and deselect which models
to examine by clicking on their icons.
	       <dl>
		 <dt> <b><a href="compare.htm">Model Output</a></b>
		      <dd>This view shows the simulated or predicted output of the selected
		      models together with the actually measured output. 
		      The calculations are carried out for the <a href="idmw.htm#workval">
		      validation data set</a>
		<dt> <b><a href="resid.htm">Model Resids</a></b>
		     <dd>This view shows the result of residual analysis for the each of
		     selected models. The residuals (prediction errors) are computed using
		     the <a href="idmw.htm#workval">validation data set</a>, and then their 
		     correlation functions are shown.
                <dt> <b><a href="idtrresp.htm">Transient Response</a></b>
		     <dd>This view shows the transient response (impulse or step response) 
		     of the selected models.
                <dt> <b><a href="bodeplot.htm">Frequency Response</a></b>
		     <dd>This view shows the frequency functions of the selected models.
                <dt> <b><a href="zpplot.htm">Zeros and Poles</a></b>			    
                <dd>This view shows the Zeros and Poles of the selected models.
                <dt> <b><a href="idspect.htm">Noise Spectrum</a></b>
		     <dd>This view shows the spectrum of the additive noise of the selected models. 
		     In case a time series is modeled, its spectrum is shown.
                <dt> <b><a href="idlti.htm">LTI Viewer</a></b>
		     <dd>This view is offered to users that have The
	Control System Toolbox's LTI Viewer.
