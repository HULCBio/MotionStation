<title>Multi-output ARX-models</title>
For a multi-output ARX structure with NY outputs and NU inputs, the
orders [NA NB NK] define the model structure as follows:
<dl>

    <dt>NA: <dd>an NY by NY matrix whose i-j entry is the order of the
        polynomial (in the delay operator) that relates the
        j'th output to the i'th output.
    <dt>NB: <dd>an NY by NU matrix whose i-j entry is the order of the 
        polynomial that relates the j'th input to the i'th output.
    <dt>NK: <dd>an NY by NU matrix whose i-j entry is the delay from
        the j'th input to the i'th output.
</dl>
The Order Editor allows the choices:
<ul>
    <li>NA = na*ones(NY,NY)
    <li>NB = nb*ones(NY,NU)
    <li>NK = nk*ones(NY,NU)
</ul>
where na, nb, and nk are chosen by the pop-up menus.
<p>
For tailor made choices, construct a matrix [NA NB NK] in the
MATLAB command window and enter the name of this matrix in the
Orders: edit box of the Parametric Models dialog.
