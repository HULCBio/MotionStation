<title>Help: Model Output</title>
<center><h3>Model Output.</h3></center>
The Model output window is opened by checking the corresponding check box 
in the ident window.<p>
The plots show the simulated (predicted) outputs of selected models.
The models are fed with inputs from the Validation Data set, whose output
is plotted in black (in white on a black blackground).<p>
The plot takes somewhat different forms depending on the character of the validation data.
This could be
<dl><dt>Time domain data (white background color)<dd>
Then the simulated or predicted model output is shown together with the measured validatation
data.
<dt>Frequency domain data (light green background color)<dd>
Then the amplitude of the (complex-valued) model output (i.e. the input Fourier
Transform times the model's frequency function) is shown together with the measured
output's amplitude. In this case 'Predicted model output' has no meaning.
<dt>Frequency Function data (light brown background color.<dd>
Then the amplitude curves of the data's and the models' frequency responses are shown.
In this case 'Predicted model output' has no meaning.

In all the cases,
the percentage of the output variations that is reproduced by the model
is displayed at the side of the plot. A higher number meas a better model.<p>
The precise definition of the fit is:<p>
FIT = [1 - NORM(Y - YHAT)/NORM(Y -MEAN(Y))]*100<P>
where Y is the measured output and YHAT is the simulated/predicted model
output.  The time span over which the fit is measured
can be changed under the Options submenu Customized time span for fit.
<p>

There are submenus under the Options menu, which allow you to choose between 
simulated and predicted model output.  There are also options to show measured 
and model outputs together or to show the difference between them.<p>

An intuitive interpretation of a K-step ahead predicted output is to see
it as a result of a simulation, using the actual input, that was started
at the correct (measured) output level K samples earlier. K is called the 
prediction horizon. It can be changed under the Options submenu Set 
prediction horizon. <p>
