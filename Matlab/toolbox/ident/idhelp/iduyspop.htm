<title>Options for Data Spectra</title>
<b>Additional Options submenus:<hr>
<dl>
 <dt>Periodogram
 <dt>Spectral analysis</b>
    <dd>These mutually exclusive checkmenus choose how the spectra is computed. 
    A periodogram is computed as the absolute square of the Fourier transform, 
    divided by the number of data points, and multiplied by the sampling interval.
    A spectral analysis is performed according to the options set in the dialog
    accessed by choosing 'Spectral Model' from the Estimate pop-up menu in the ident window.
    Note that in this case only scalar resolution parameters are accepted for the SPAFDR
    case, and that the frequency range is always deternined from the plot window's
    Options &gt Frequency range menu.<p>

 <dt><b>Frequency range...</b>
    <dd>Opens a dialog for customizing the frequency range.  
    The default choice is 128 linearly spaced values up to the Nyquist frequency.
