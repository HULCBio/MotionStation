<title>Setting the Confidence Level</title>
The size of the confidence region is determined by the chosen level of confidence. It can be expressed as the probabilty (i.e., a number between 0 and 1) that the true system can be found within the region. 
<p>The probability is computed under the assumption that the estimate has a normal distribution. Alternatively, the confidence region can be expressed as a number of standard deviations. For example, a probability of 0.99 (99%) corresponds to 2.58 standard deviations.<p>

There are three ways to set the confidence level:
<ol>
<li>Enter the desired number of standard deviations in the left edit box,
<li>Enter the desired confidence level in the right edit box,
<li>Use the slider to change the values.
</ol><p>
Press Apply to compute and plot the new confidence intervals.
