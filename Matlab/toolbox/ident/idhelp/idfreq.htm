<title>Setting Frequency Values</title>
Enter a row vector that contains the frequency values (in rad/s) to be used 
in the Frequency resp View.<p>

Any one line MATLAB expression can be used to define this row vector.<br>
Example 1: <tt>[1:100]*pi/100</tt><br>
Example 2: <tt>logspace(-3,-1,200)</tt><p>

When the frequency value option has been changed, all the curves in the Frequency resp View are redrawn for the new frequency values, except those curves that correspond to spectral analysis estimates. These will always be given for the frequency values that were chosen at the time the estimate was created.
<p>
The default value for the frequency values is 128 points linearly distributed up to and including the Nyquist frequency (not including frequency zero). The default value is obtained by entering the empty matrix.
