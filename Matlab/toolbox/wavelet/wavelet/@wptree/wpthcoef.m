function t = wpthcoef(t,keepapp,sorh,thr)
%WPTHCOEF Wavelet packet coefficients thresholding.
%   NEWT = WPTHCOEF(T,KEEPAPP,SORH,THR) 
%   returns the new wavelet packet tree NEWT 
%   obtained from the wavelet packet tree T 
%   by coefficients thresholding.
%
%   If KEEPAPP = 1, approximation coefficients are not
%   thresholded, otherwise it is possible.
%   If SORH = 's', soft thresholding is applied,
%   if SORH = 'h', hard thresholding is applied (see WTHRESH).
%   
%   THR is the threshold value.
%
%   See also WPDEC, WPDEC2, WPDENCMP, WTHRESH.
