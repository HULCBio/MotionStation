      <h2>Traveling salesman problem<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>The traveling salesman problem is an optimization problem where there is a finite number of cities, and the cost of travel
         between each city is known. The goal is to find an ordered set of all the cities for the salesman to visit such that the cost
         is minimized. To solve the traveling salesman problem, we need a list of city locations and distances, or cost, between each
         of them.
      </p>
      <p>Our salesman is visiting cities in the United States. The file usborder.mat contains a map of the United States in the variables
         x and y, and a geometrically simplified version of the same map in the variables xx and yy.

</pre><h2>Customizing the genetic algorithm for a custom data type<a name="5"></a></h2>
      <p>By default, the genetic algorithm solver solves optimization problems based on double and binary string data types. The functions
         for creation, crossover, and mutation assume the population is a matrix of type double, or logical in the case of binary strings.
         The genetic algorithm solver can also work on optimization problems involving arbitrary data types. You can use any data structure
         you like for your population. For example, a custom data type can be specified using a MATLAB cell array. In order to use
         GA with a population of type cell array you must provide a creation function, a crossover function, and a mutation function
         that will work on your data type, e.g., a cell array.
      </p>
      <h2>Required functions for the traveling salesman problem<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>This section demonstrates how to create and register the three required functions. An individual in the population for the
         traveling salesman problem is an ordered set, and so the population can easily be represented using a cell array. The custom
         creation function for the traveling salesman problem will create a cell array, say P, where each element represents an ordered
         set of cities as a permutation vector. That is, the salesman will travel in the order specified in P{i}. The creation function
         will return a cell array of size PopulationSize.

%% Customizing the genetic algorithm for a custom data type

% based on double and binary string data types. The functions for creation,

%% Required functions for the traveling salesman problem
% This section demonstrates how to create and register the three required
% functions. An individual in the population for the traveling salesman
% problem is an ordered set, and so the population can easily be
% represented using a cell array. The custom creation function for the
% traveling salesman problem will create a cell array, say P, where each
% element represents an ordered set of cities as a permutation vector. That
% is, the salesman will travel in the order specified in P{i}. The creation
% function will return a cell array of size PopulationSize. 
type create_permutations.m

%%
% The custom crossover function takes a cell array, the population, and
% returns a cell array, the children that result from the crossover.
type crossover_permutation.m

%%
% The custom mutation function takes an individual, which is an ordered set
% of cities, and returns a mutated ordered set.
type mutate_permutation.m

%%
% We also need a fitness function for the traveling salesman problem. The
% fitness of an individual is the total distance traveled for an ordered
% set of cities. The fitness function also needs the distance matrix to
% calculate the total distance.  
type traveling_salesman_fitness.m

%%
% GA will call our fitness function with just one argument 'x', but our
% fitness function has two arguments: x, distances. We can use an anonymous
% function to capture the values of the additional argument, the distances
% matrix. We create a function handle 'FitnessFcn' to an anonymous function
% that takes one input 'x', but calls 'traveling_salesman_fitness' with x,
% and distances. The variable, distances has a value when the function handle
% 'FitnessFcn' is created, so these values are captured by the anonymous
% function.
%distances defined earlier
FitnessFcn = @(x) traveling_salesman_fitness(x,distances);

%%
% We can add a custom plot function to plot the location of the cities and
% the current best route. A red circle represents a city and the blue
% lines represent a valid path between two cities.
type traveling_salesman_plot.m

%% 
% Once again we will use an anonymous function to create a function handle
% to an anonymous function which calls 'traveling_salesman_plot' with the
% additional argument 'locations'. 
%locations defined earlier
my_plot = @(options,state,flag) traveling_salesman_plot(options, ...
            state,flag,locations);

%% Genetic Algorithm options setup
% First, we will create an options structure to indicate a custom data type
% and the population range.
options = gaoptimset('PopulationType', 'custom','PopInitRange', ...
                     [1;cities]);

%%
% We choose the custom creation, crossover, mutation, and plot functions that
% we have created, as well as setting some stopping conditions. 
options = gaoptimset(options,'CreationFcn',@create_permutations, ...
                             'CrossoverFcn',@crossover_permutation, ...

                             'StallGenLimit',200,'Vectorized','on');
%%
% Finally, we call the genetic algorithm with our problem information.

numberOfVariables = cities;
[x,fval,reason,output] = ga(FitnessFcn,numberOfVariables,options)

%%
% The plot shows the location of the cities in blue circles as well as the
% path found by the genetic algorithm that the salesman will travel. The
