%SPLPP Left Taylor coefficients from local B-coefficients.
%
%   [V,B] = SPLPP(TX,A)
%
%   uses knot insertion to derive from the B-spline coefficients
%   A(.,:) relevant for the interval [TX(.,k-1) .. TX(.,k)]  (with
%   respect to the knot sequence TX(.,1:2k-2) )  the B-spline
%   coefficients B(.,1:k) relevant for the interval  [TX(.,k-1) .. 0]
%   (with respect to the knot sequence [TX(.,1:k-1),0,...,0] ), with
%   [ ,k]:=size(A) .
%
%   It is assumed that  TX(.,k-1) < 0 <= TX(.,k) .
%
%   From this, computes V(j) := D^{k-j}s(0-)/(k-j)!  , j=1,...,k ,
%   with  s  the spline described by the given knots and coefficients.

% Note: the first B-spline has knots tx_0,...,tx_k, but its evaluation only
% uses tx_1,...,tx_k . Similarly, the evaluation of the last, or k-th, B-spline
% only requires its `interior' knots  tx_k,...,tx_(2k-2) .
%
% Since the first B-spline has knots  tx_0,...,tx_k , we have  t_j=tx_(j-1) in
% the usual formulae. E.g., in the first step, we overwrite
%  a(j)  by  (-tx_(j-1)a(j)+tx_(j+k-2)a(j-1))/(-tx_...+tx_...) ,
% and do this for  j=2,...,k.
