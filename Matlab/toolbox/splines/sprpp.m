function [v,b] = sprpp(tx,a)
%SPRPP Right Taylor coefficients from local B-coefficients.
%
%   [V,B] = SPRPP(TX,A)
%
%   uses knot insertion to derive from the B-spline coefficients
%   A(.,:) relevant for the interval  [TX(.,k-1) .. TX(.,k)]  (with
%   respect to the knot sequence  TX(.,1:2k-2) )  the polynomial
%   coefficients V(.,1:k) relevant for the interval  [0 .. TX(.,k)] .
%   Here,    [ ,k] := size(A) .
%   Also, it is assumed that  TX(.,k-1) <= 0 < TX(.,k) .
%
%   In the process, uses repeated insertion of  0  to derive, in
%   B(.,1:k) , the B-spline coefficients relevant for the interval
%   [0 .. TX(.,k)]  (with respect to the knot sequence
%   [0,...,0,TX(.,k:2*(k-1))]) .
