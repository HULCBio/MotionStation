% The instrument class (directory) provides methods for the serial
% port object. 
%
% The instrument class is provided for consistency between MATLAB's
% serial port object and the Instrument Control Toolbox's serial port
% object. MATLAB's serial port object and the Instrument Control Toolbox 
% serial port object are identical. However, there are additional methods 
% in the Instrument Control Toolbox which operate on the serial port object.
