function varargout = load(varargin)
%LOAD Initialize a COM object from a file.
%  LOAD(OBJ, FILENAME) Initializes the COM object OBJ from file FILENAME.
%  FILENAME is the full pathname of the serialized data. The file must
%  have been created previously by serializing an instance of the same
%  object using the SAVE function.
%
%   Equivalent syntax is
%      S = OBJ.LOAD(FILENAME)
