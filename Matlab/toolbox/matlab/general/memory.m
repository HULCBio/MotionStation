%MEMORY Help for memory limitations.
%   If the OUT OF MEMORY error message is encountered, there is
%   no more room in memory for new variables. You must free up
%   some space before you may proceed. One way to free up space
%   is to delete some variables (see CLEAR). Another is to
%   issue the command PACK (See PACK). PACK compresses the data
%   in memory, opening up larger contiguous blocks.
%
%   Here are some additional system specific tips:
%   Windows:    Increase virtual memory by using System in the Control Panel.
%   Unix:       Ask your system manager to increase your Swap Space.
