=head1 NAME

Win32::Mutex - Use Win32 mutex objects from Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	require Win32::Mutex;

	$mutex = Win32::Mutex->new($initial,$name);
	$mutex->wait;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows access to the Win32 mutex objects.  The C<wait>
method and C<wait_all> & C<wait_any> functions are inherited from the
L<"Win32::IPC"> module.

=head2 Methods

=over 4

=item $mutex = Win32::Mutex->new([$initial, [$name]])

Constructor for a new mutex object.  If C<$initial> is true, requests
immediate ownership of the mutex (default false).  If C<$name> is
omitted, creates an unnamed mutex object.

If C<$name> signifies an existing mutex object, then C<$initial> is
ignored and the object is opened.

=item $mutex = Win32::Mutex->open($name)

Constructor for opening an existing mutex object.

=item $mutex->release

Release ownership of a C<$mutex>.  You should have obtained ownership
of the mutex through C<new> or one of the wait functions.  Returns
true if successful.

=item $mutex->wait([$timeout])

Wait for ownership of C<$mutex>.  See L<"Win32::IPC">.

=head2 Deprecated Functions and Methods

B<Win32::Mutex> still supports the ActiveWare syntax, but its use is
deprecated.

=item Create($MutObj,$Initial,$Name)

Use C<$MutObj = Win32::Mutex-E<gt>new($Initial,$Name)> instead.

=item Open($MutObj,$Name)

Use C<$MutObj = Win32::Mutex-E<gt>open($Name)> instead.

=item $MutObj->Release()

Use C<$MutObj-E<gt>release> instead.
