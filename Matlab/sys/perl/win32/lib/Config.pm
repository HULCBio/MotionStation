=head1 NAME

Config - access Perl configuration information

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Config;
    if ($Config{'cc'} =~ /gcc/) {
	print "built by gcc\n";
    } 

    use Config qw(myconfig config_sh config_vars);

    print myconfig();

    print config_sh();

    config_vars(qw(osname archname));


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Config module contains all the information that was available to
the C<Configure> program at Perl build time (over 900 values).

Shell variables from the F<config.sh> file (written by Configure) are
stored in the readonly-variable C<%Config>, indexed by their names.

Values stored in config.sh as 'undef' are returned as undefined
values.  The perl C<exists> function can be used to check if a
named variable exists.

=over 4

=item myconfig()

Returns a textual summary of the major perl configuration values.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Here's a more sophisticated example of using %Config:

    use Config;
    use strict;

    my %sig_num;
    my @sig_name;
    unless($Config{sig_name} && $Config{sig_num}) {
	die "No sigs?";
    } else {
	my @names = split ' ', $Config{sig_name};
	@sig_num{@names} = split ' ', $Config{sig_num};
	foreach (@names) {
	    $sig_name[$sig_num{$_}] ||= $_;
	}   
    }

    print "signal #17 = $sig_name[17]\n";
    if ($sig_num{ALRM}) { 
	print "SIGALRM is $sig_num{ALRM}\n";
    }   

=head1 WARNING

Because this information is not stored within the perl executable
itself it is possible (but unlikely) that the information does not
relate to the actual perl binary which is being used to access it.

The Config module is installed into the architecture and version
specific library directory ($Config{installarchlib}) and it checks the
perl version number when loaded.

The values stored in config.sh may be either single-quoted or
double-quoted. Double-quoted strings are handy for those cases where you
need to include escape sequences in the strings. To avoid runtime variable
interpolation, any C<$> and C<@> characters are replaced by C<\$> and
C<\@>, respectively. This isn't foolproof, of course, so don't embed C<\$>
or C<\@> in double-quoted strings unless you're willing to deal with the
consequences. (The slashes will end up escaped and the C<$> or C<@> will
trigger variable interpolation)

=head1 GLOSSARY

Most C<Config> variables are determined by the C<Configure> script
on platforms supported by it (which is most UNIX platforms).  Some
platforms have custom-made C<Config> variables, and may thus not have
some of the variables described below, or may have extraneous variables
specific to that particular port.  See the port specific documentation
in such cases.

=head2 M

=over

=item C<Mcc>

From F<Loc.U>:

This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
full pathname (if any) of the Mcc program.  After Configure runs,
the value is reset to a plain C<Mcc> and is not useful.

=back

=head2 _

=over

=item C<_a>

From F<Unix.U>:

This variable defines the extension used for ordinary libraries.
For unix, it is F<.a>.  The F<.> is included.  Other possible
values include F<.lib>.

=item C<_exe>

From F<Unix.U>:

This variable defines the extension used for executable files.
For unix it is empty.  Other possible values include F<.exe>.

=item C<_o>

From F<Unix.U>:

This variable defines the extension used for object files.
For unix, it is F<.o>.  The F<.> is included.  Other possible
values include F<.obj>.

=back

=head2 a

=over

=item C<afs>

From F<afs.U>:

This variable is set to C<true> if C<AFS> (Andrew File System) is used
on the system, C<false> otherwise.  It is possible to override this

double. Usual values are 2, 4 and 8.

=item C<ansi2knr>

=item C<aphostname>

From F<d_gethname.U>:

Thie variable contains the command which can be used to compute the
host name. The command is fully qualified by its absolute path, to make

=item C<apiversion>

From F<patchlevel.U>:

This is a number which identifies the lowest version of perl
to have an C<API> (for C<XS> extensions) compatible with the present
version.  For example, for 5.005_01, the apiversion should be
5.005, since 5.005_01 should be binary compatible with 5.005.
This should probably be incremented manually somehow, perhaps
from F<patchlevel.h>.  For now, we'll guess maintenance subversions
will retain binary compatibility.

=item C<shrpenv>

From F<libperl.U>:

If the user builds a shared F<libperl.so>, then we need to tell the
C<perl> executable where it will be able to find the installed F<libperl.so>. 
One way to do this on some systems is to set the environment variable
C<LD_RUN_PATH> to the directory that will be the final location of the
shared F<libperl.so>.  The makefile can use this with something like

	$shrpenv $(C<CC>) -o perl F<perlmain.o> $libperl $libs

	Typical values are

	shrpenv="env C<LD_RUN_PATH>=$F<archlibexp/C<CORE>>"

	or

	shrpenv=''

	See the main perl F<Makefile.SH> for actual working usage.
Alternatively, we might be able to use a command line option such
as -R $F<archlibexp/C<CORE>> (Solaris, NetBSD) or -Wl,-rpath
$F<archlibexp/C<CORE>> (Linux).
