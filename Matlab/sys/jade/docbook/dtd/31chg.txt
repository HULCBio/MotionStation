Changes from DocBook V3.0 to DocBook V3.1:

Markup:

- Added optional title to MsgSet 

- Add FAQ as a class value to Article 

- Cleaned up, and significantly loosened, the content model of Book.

- Added Colophon to Book.

- Added inline Constant for marking up constants and limits

- Added inline VarName for marking up variable names

- Added several elements to the content model of ArtHeader that were
  accidentally left out in 3.0: Graphic, LegalNotice, ModeSpec,
  SubjectSet, KeywordSet, and ITermSet.

- Add LinkEnd to LoTEntry.

- Sets are no longer required to contain at least two books.

- Added pagewide attribute to Figure. 

- Added recursive Divisions.

- Added Subtitle to divisions (Set, Book, etc.), components, and
  sections.  It may occur outside of *Info elements.

- Added person name elements to Address.

- Added Class attribute to LiteralLayout indicating Monospaced or
  Normal font.

- Added ULink to docinfo.char.mix.

- Added RevHistory to GlossEntry.

- Added Title, TitleAbbrev, and SubTitle outside ArtHeader; ArtHeader
  is now optional.

- Added QAndASet, MediaObject, and InlineMediaObject.

- Added IndexTerm to the content model of many elements.  This makes
  it easier to store small, valid components.  Previously, IndexTerms
  were only valid if the root element had the appropriate inclusion.

Other:

- Added underscore (_) to the list of acceptable name characters.
  (Underscores can now be used in IDs.)

- The public identifiers have changed.  The owner identifier is now
  "-//OASIS//".

- Parameterized element and attribute declarations separately.

- Notation and character entity declarations now have their own modules.

- Fixed erroneous comment marking the end of the programlistingco.module.

- Fixed unused parameter entities: local.keyaction.attrib,
  country.role.attrib, local.areaset.attrib, local.bibliomixed.attrib,

- Removed unused parameter entities local.setinfo.char.mix, yes.attval,
  and linkendsreq.attrib.

- Parameterized inclusions and exclusions for easy removal.

- General coding and comment cleanup.
