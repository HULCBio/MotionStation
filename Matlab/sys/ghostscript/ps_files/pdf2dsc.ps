% Modified by Johannes Plass <plass@dipmza.physik.uni-mainz.de> 1996-11-05:
%	Adds BoundingBox and Orientation if available.
% Modified by rjl/lpd 9/19/96
%	Updates for compatibility with modified pdf_*.ps code for handling
%	  page ranges (i.e., partial files) better.
% Modified by Geoff Keating <Geoff.Keating@anu.edu.au> 7/3/96:
%	include Title and CreationDate DSC comments (these are displayed by
%	  Ghostview);
%	reduce the size of typical output files by a factor of about 3.
% Modified by L. Peter Deutsch 3/18/96:
%	Removes unnecessary and error-prone code duplicated from pdf_main.ps
