                               README

The files in this directory fall into two categories:

   * Example source code files; some are written as M-files and 
     some are written in the C language. 
   * Files to help you build and configure the source code files into 
     stand-alone external applications.

The "MATLAB Compiler User's Guide" details most of the files in this
directory.  


                   *******************************
                      EXAMPLE SOURCE CODE FILES
                   *******************************

The Makefile found in this directory will build the following
applications on UNIX.  The user needs to modify the MATLABROOT
environment variable found in the Makefile to indicate the appropriate
location of the root directory of MATLAB.

flames.m and flames.mat Graphics Example with a MAT-file
--------------------------------------------------------

The "MATLAB Compiler User's Guide" describes example of creating a 
standalone application from a single M-file that uses MATLAB graphics 
and a MAT file. The sample M-file and the MAT-file are:

  * flames.m, which is a function M-file that uses flames.mat.
  * flames.mat, which is a MATLAB data file that contains the data for
    the graphic that is displayed.

main.m and mrank.m: Build Two M-Files Into a Stand-Alone External Application
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "MATLAB Compiler User's Guide" explains how to build 
two M-files into a stand-alone external application.  The two sample
M-files are: 

   * main.m, which is a function M-file that calls mrank.
   * mrank.m, which is a function M-file that calculates the rank of
     n magic squares.

See the "MATLAB Compiler User's Guide" for details on building this 
application.


mrank.m, printmatrix.m and mrankp.c: Build an M-File and C file into a Stand-Alone
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "MATLAB Compiler User's Guide" explains how to build  an M-file and 
C-file into a stand-alone external application. A simple example M-file 
and C file combination is: 

   * mrankp.c, which is a main C function that calls mrank and prints the
     results returned by mrank.
   * mrank.m, which is a function M-file that calculates the rank of
     n magic squares.
   * printmatrix.m, which takes in a matrix and prints its value.

See the "MATLAB Compiler User's Guide" for details on building this 
application.


multargp.c, multarg.m, printmatrix.m: Advanced Example
------------------------------------------------------

The "MATLAB Compiler User's Guide" describes a more complicated example 
of coding a stand-alone external application.  The sample files in this 
example are:

   * multargp.c, which is a C function that calls multarg and prints
     the results returned by multarg.
   * multarg.m, which is a function M-file that contains two input and 
     two output arguments.
   * printmatrix.m, which takes in a matrix and prints its value.

See the "MATLAB Compiler User's Guide" for details on building this 
application.


matrixdriver.c, addmatrix.m, multiplymatrix.m, eigmatrix.m: Advanced Example
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "MATLAB Compiler User's Guide" describes a more complicated example 
of coding a stand-alone external application.  The sample files in this 
example are:

   * matrixdriver.c, which is a C function that calls the various m-files 
     listed above and prints the results.
   * addmatrix.m, which is a function M-file that takes two matrices and 
     returns the addition of the two matrices.
   * multiplymatrix.m, which is a function M-file that takes two matrices and 
     returns the multiplication of the two matrices.
   * eigmatrix.m, which is a function M-file that takes a matrix and 
     returns the eigen value of the same.

See the "MATLAB Compiler User's Guide" for details on building this 
application.
