Ada S-Functions
---------------

 The directory matlabroot/simulink/ada/ contains all the files required
 for building Ada S-Functions.

 We currently support the GNAT Ada95 compiler for Windows NT, Solaris and
 GNU-Linux platforms. This implementation requires the GNAT Ada95 compiler
 Version 3.12 (or higher). The binaries distributed by GNAT come with both
 the C and Ada compilers. Note that you can obtain a free copy of the GNAT
 Ada compiler from the GNAT ftp site (ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/gnat). You can
 also purchase a professional version from Ada Core Technologies
 (www.gnat.com).

 We interface your Ada code to Simulink by creating a dynamic link library
 (.dll) on the PC or shared object on Unix. We use the term MEX (Matlab
 executable) to refer to a dynamically linked binary built specifically for
 Matlab/Simulink. The API for Ada S-functions consist of both C and Ada code.
 The C code is used as a gateway between Simulink and your Ada code. We use
 standard Ada95 pragmas for interfacing the Ada to the C code.

 On your part, you need to write the Ada S-Function as a package, with a body
 and a spec, 'sfcn.adb' and 'sfcn.ads', respectively. The following command
 builds an Ada S-Function sfcn.ads[b] into a MEX-File

 	  mex [-v] [-g] -ada sfcn.ads

 where the optional switches, -v prints all the compiler and linker commands
 and output, and -g builds the MEX-File with debugging symbols included.
 Once you have successfully built the Ada S-Function into a MEX-File, you can
 use this MEX-File as an S-Function in the Simulink S-function block. Please
 refer to the Simulink documentation for more information about S-Functions.

 See the source code for the example Ada S-Functions in the sub-directories
 under the matlabroot/simulink/ada/examples/ directory.

 Also see the example simulink model that demonstrates Ada S-Functions:

 	 sfcndemo_ada_simple_lookup

 You can open this model by simply typing the above line at the MATLAB prompt.
 This model lives in matlabroot/toolbox/simulink/simdemos/ directory as
 sfcndemo_ada_simple_lookup.mdl

 Any feedback (bugs, enhancements, etc) regarding this new feature will be
 greatly appreciated.
