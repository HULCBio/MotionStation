   A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/2/10.
   Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
   This is a faster version by taking Shawn Cokus's optimization,
   Matthe Bellew's simplification, Isaku Wada's real version.
   David Bateman added normal and exponential distributions following
   Marsaglia and Tang's Ziggurat algorithm.
