## @deftypefn  {Function File} {} findstr (@var{s}, @var{t})
## @deftypefnx {Function File} {} findstr (@var{s}, @var{t}, @var{overlap})
## Return the vector of all positions in the longer of the two strings
## @var{s} and @var{t} where an occurrence of the shorter of the two starts.
## If the optional argument @var{overlap} is true, the returned vector
## can include overlapping positions (this is the default).  For example:
##
## @example
## @group
## findstr ("ababab", "a")
##      @result{} [1, 3, 5];
## findstr ("abababa", "aba", 0)
##      @result{} [1, 5]
## @end group
## @end example
##
## @strong{Caution:} @code{findstr} is scheduled for deprecation.  Use
## @code{strfind} in all new code.
## @seealso{strfind, strmatch, strcmp, strncmp, strcmpi, strncmpi, find}
## @end deftypefn

## Note that this implementation swaps the strings if second one is longer
## than the first, so try to put the longer one first.
