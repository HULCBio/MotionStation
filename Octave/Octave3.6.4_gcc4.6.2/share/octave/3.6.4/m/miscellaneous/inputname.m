## Warning: heap big magic in the following tests!!!
## The test function builds a private context for each
## test, with only the specified values shared between
## them.  It does this using the following template:
##
##     function [<shared>] = testfn(<shared>)
##        <test>
##
## To test inputname, I need a function context invoked
## with known parameter names.  So define a couple of
## shared parameters, et voila!, the test is trivial.
%!shared hello,worldly
%!assert(inputname(1),'hello');
%!assert(inputname(2),'worldly');
