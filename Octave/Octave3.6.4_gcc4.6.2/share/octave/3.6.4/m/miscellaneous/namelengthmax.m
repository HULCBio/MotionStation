## @deftypefn {Function File} {} namelengthmax ()
## Return the @sc{matlab} compatible maximum variable name length.  Octave is
## capable of storing strings up to @math{2^{31} - 1} in length.
## However for @sc{matlab} compatibility all variable, function,
## and structure field names should be shorter than the length supplied by
## @code{namelengthmax}.  In particular variables stored to a @sc{matlab} file
## format will have their names truncated to this length.
## @end deftypefn

function n = namelengthmax ()
  n = 63;
endfunction
