## @deftypefn {Function File} {} hilb (@var{n})
## Return the Hilbert matrix of order @var{n}.  The @math{i,j} element
## of a Hilbert matrix is defined as
## @tex
## $$
## H(i, j) = {1 \over (i + j - 1)}
## $$
## @end tex
## @ifnottex
##
## @example
## H(i, j) = 1 / (i + j - 1)
## @end example
##
## @end ifnottex
##
## Hilbert matrices are close to being singular which make them difficult to
## invert with numerical routines.
## Comparing the condition number of a random matrix 5x5 matrix with that of
## a Hilbert matrix of order 5 reveals just how difficult the problem is.
##
## @example
## @group
## cond (rand (5))
##    @result{} 14.392
## cond (hilb (5))
##    @result{} 4.7661e+05
## @end group
## @end example
