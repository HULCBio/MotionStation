## @cindex Spearman's Rho
## Compute Spearman's rank correlation coefficient @var{rho}.
##
## For two data vectors @var{x} and @var{y}, Spearman's @var{rho} is the
## correlation coefficient of the ranks of @var{x} and @var{y}.
##
## If @var{x} and @var{y} are drawn from independent distributions,
## @var{rho} has zero mean and variance @code{1 / (n - 1)}, and is
## asymptotically normally distributed.
##
## @code{spearman (@var{x})} is equivalent to @code{spearman (@var{x},
## @var{x})}.
