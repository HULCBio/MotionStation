## @deftypefn  {Function File} {} range (@var{x})
## @deftypefnx {Function File} {} range (@var{x}, @var{dim})
## Return the range, i.e., the difference between the maximum and the minimum
## of the input data.  If @var{x} is a vector, the range is calculated over
## the elements of @var{x}.  If @var{x} is a matrix, the range is calculated
## over each column of @var{x}.
##
## If the optional argument @var{dim} is given, operate along this dimension.
##
## The range is a quickly computed measure of the dispersion of a data set, but
## is less accurate than @code{iqr} if there are outlying data points.
