## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{chisq}, @var{df}] =} chisquare_test_homogeneity (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{c})
## Given two samples @var{x} and @var{y}, perform a chisquare test for
## homogeneity of the null hypothesis that @var{x} and @var{y} come from
## the same distribution, based on the partition induced by the
## (strictly increasing) entries of @var{c}.
##
## For large samples, the test statistic @var{chisq} approximately follows a
## chisquare distribution with @var{df} = @code{length (@var{c})}
## degrees of freedom.
##
## The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at @var{chisq}) is
## returned in @var{pval}.
##
## If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.
