## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{t}, @var{df}] =} welch_test (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{alt})
## For two samples @var{x} and @var{y} from normal distributions with
## unknown means and unknown and not necessarily equal variances,
## perform a Welch test of the null hypothesis of equal means.
## Under the null, the test statistic @var{t} approximately follows a
## Student distribution with @var{df} degrees of freedom.
##
## With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
## interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
## @code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
## @code{mean (@var{x}) != @var{m}}.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"}, the
## one-sided alternative mean(x) > @var{m} is considered.  Similarly for
## @code{"<"}, the one-sided alternative mean(x) < @var{m} is
## considered.  The default is the two-sided case.
##
## The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.
##
## If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
