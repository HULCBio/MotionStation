## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{z}] =} z_test (@var{x}, @var{m}, @var{v}, @var{alt})
## Perform a Z-test of the null hypothesis @code{mean (@var{x}) ==
## @var{m}} for a sample @var{x} from a normal distribution with unknown
## mean and known variance @var{v}.  Under the null, the test statistic
## @var{z} follows a standard normal distribution.
##
## With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
## interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
## @code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
## @code{mean (@var{x}) != @var{m}}.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"}, the
## one-sided alternative @code{mean (@var{x}) > @var{m}} is considered.
## Similarly for @code{"<"}, the one-sided alternative @code{mean
## (@var{x}) < @var{m}} is considered.  The default is the two-sided
## case.
##
## The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.
##
## If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed
## along with some information.
