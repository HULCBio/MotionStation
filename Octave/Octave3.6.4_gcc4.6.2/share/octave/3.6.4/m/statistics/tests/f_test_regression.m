## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{f}, @var{df_num}, @var{df_den}] =} f_test_regression (@var{y}, @var{x}, @var{rr}, @var{r})
## Perform an F test for the null hypothesis rr * b = r in a classical
## normal regression model y = X * b + e.
##
## Under the null, the test statistic @var{f} follows an F distribution
## with @var{df_num} and @var{df_den} degrees of freedom.
##
## The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at @var{f}) is
## returned in @var{pval}.
##
## If not given explicitly, @var{r} = 0.
##
## If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.
