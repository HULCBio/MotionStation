## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{f}, @var{df_b}, @var{df_w}] =} anova (@var{y}, @var{g})
## Perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).  The goal is to test
## whether the population means of data taken from @var{k} different
## groups are all equal.
##
## Data may be given in a single vector @var{y} with groups specified by
## a corresponding vector of group labels @var{g} (e.g., numbers from 1
## to @var{k}).  This is the general form which does not impose any
## restriction on the number of data in each group or the group labels.
##
## If @var{y} is a matrix and @var{g} is omitted, each column of @var{y}
## is treated as a group.  This form is only appropriate for balanced
## ANOVA in which the numbers of samples from each group are all equal.
##
## Under the null of constant means, the statistic @var{f} follows an F
## distribution with @var{df_b} and @var{df_w} degrees of freedom.
##
## The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at @var{f}) is
## returned in @var{pval}.
##
## If no output argument is given, the standard one-way ANOVA table is
## printed.
