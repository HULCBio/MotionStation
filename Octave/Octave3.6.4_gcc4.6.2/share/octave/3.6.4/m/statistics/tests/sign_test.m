## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{b}, @var{n}] =} sign_test (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{alt})
## For two matched-pair samples @var{x} and @var{y}, perform a sign test
## of the null hypothesis PROB (@var{x} > @var{y}) == PROB (@var{x} <
## @var{y}) == 1/2.  Under the null, the test statistic @var{b} roughly
## follows a binomial distribution with parameters @code{@var{n} = sum
## (@var{x} != @var{y})} and @var{p} = 1/2.
##
## With the optional argument @code{alt}, the alternative of interest
## can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or @code{"<>"}, the
## null hypothesis is tested against the two-sided alternative PROB
## (@var{x} < @var{y}) != 1/2.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"}, the
## one-sided alternative PROB (@var{x} > @var{y}) > 1/2 ("x is
## stochastically greater than y") is considered.  Similarly for
## @code{"<"}, the one-sided alternative PROB (@var{x} > @var{y}) < 1/2
## ("x is stochastically less than y") is considered.  The default is
## the two-sided case.
##
## The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.
##
## If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
