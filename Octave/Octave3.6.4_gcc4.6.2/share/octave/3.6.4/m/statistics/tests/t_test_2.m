## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{t}, @var{df}] =} t_test_2 (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{alt})
## For two samples x and y from normal distributions with unknown means
## and unknown equal variances, perform a two-sample t-test of the null
## hypothesis of equal means.  Under the null, the test statistic
## @var{t} follows a Student distribution with @var{df} degrees of
## freedom.
##
## With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
## interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
## @code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
## @code{mean (@var{x}) != mean (@var{y})}.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"},
## the one-sided alternative @code{mean (@var{x}) > mean (@var{y})} is
## used.  Similarly for @code{"<"}, the one-sided alternative @code{mean
## (@var{x}) < mean (@var{y})} is used.  The default is the two-sided
## case.
##
## The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.
##
## If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
