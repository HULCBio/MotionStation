## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{ks}, @var{d}] =} kolmogorov_smirnov_test_2 (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{alt})
## Perform a 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the null hypothesis
## that the samples @var{x} and @var{y} come from the same (continuous)
## distribution.  I.e., if F and G are the CDFs corresponding to the
## @var{x} and @var{y} samples, respectively, then the null is that F ==
## G.
##
## With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
## interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
## @code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative F
## != G@.  In this case, the test statistic @var{ks} follows a two-sided
## Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.  If @var{alt} is @code{">"}, the
## one-sided alternative F > G is considered.  Similarly for @code{"<"},
## the one-sided alternative F < G is considered.  In this case, the
## test statistic @var{ks} has a one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov
## distribution.  The default is the two-sided case.
##
## The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.
##
## The third returned value, @var{d}, is the test statistic, the maximum
## vertical distance between the two cumulative distribution functions.
##
## If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.
