## @deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{z}] =} wilcoxon_test (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{alt})
## For two matched-pair sample vectors @var{x} and @var{y}, perform a
## Wilcoxon signed-rank test of the null hypothesis PROB (@var{x} >
## @var{y}) == 1/2.  Under the null, the test statistic @var{z}
## approximately follows a standard normal distribution when @var{n} > 25.
##
## @strong{Caution:} This function assumes a normal distribution for @var{z}
## and thus is invalid for @var{n} @leq{} 25.
##
## With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
## interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or
## @code{"<>"}, the null is tested against the two-sided alternative
## PROB (@var{x} > @var{y}) != 1/2.  If alt is @code{">"}, the one-sided
## alternative PROB (@var{x} > @var{y}) > 1/2 is considered.  Similarly
## for @code{"<"}, the one-sided alternative PROB (@var{x} > @var{y}) <
## 1/2 is considered.  The default is the two-sided case.
##
## The p-value of the test is returned in @var{pval}.
##
## If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is displayed.
