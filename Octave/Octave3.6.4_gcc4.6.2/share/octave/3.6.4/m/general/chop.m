## @deftypefn {Function File} {} chop (@var{x}, @var{ndigits}, @var{base})
## Truncate elements of @var{x} to a length of @var{ndigits} such that the
## resulting numbers are exactly divisible by @var{base}.  If @var{base} is not
## specified it defaults to 10.
##
## @example
## @group
## chop (-pi, 5, 10)
##    @result{} -3.14200000000000
## chop (-pi, 5, 5)
##    @result{} -3.14150000000000
## @end group
## @end example
## @end deftypefn

function retval = chop (x, ndigits, base = 10)

  if (nargin == 2 || nargin == 3)
    tmp = abs (x);

    ## Avoid computing log (0).
    tmp(x == 0) = 1;

    ## Digits to the left of the decimal.
    tmp = floor (log10 (tmp) + 1);

    ## The expression
    ##
    ##   round (x .* inflate)
    ##
    ## produces an integer that contains the digits we want to keep.
    ## Multiplying by deflate puts the decimal back where it belngs.
    ##
    ## Further scaling and rounding with the base factor produces a
    ## value with ndigits exactly divisible by base.  We skip that step
    ## unless base was explicitly provided.

    inflate = 10 .^ (ndigits - tmp);
    deflate = 10 .^ (tmp - ndigits);
    if (nargin == 2)
      retval = deflate .* round (x .* inflate);
    else
      retval = base .* deflate .* round (round (x .* inflate) ./ base);
