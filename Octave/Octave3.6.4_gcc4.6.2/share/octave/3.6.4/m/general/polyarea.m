##
## Determine area of a polygon by triangle method.  The variables
## @var{x} and @var{y} define the vertex pairs, and must therefore have
## the same shape.  They can be either vectors or arrays.  If they are
## arrays then the columns of @var{x} and @var{y} are treated separately
## and an area returned for each.
##
## If the optional @var{dim} argument is given, then @code{polyarea}
## works along this dimension of the arrays @var{x} and @var{y}.
##
## @end deftypefn

## todo:  Add moments for centroid, etc.
##
## bugs and limitations:
##        Probably ought to be an optional check to make sure that
##        traversing the vertices doesn't make any sides cross
##        (Is simple closed curve the technical definition of this?).
