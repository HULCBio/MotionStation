## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{b} =} loadobj (@var{a})
## Method of a class to manipulate an object after loading it from a file.
## The function @code{loadobj} is called when the object @var{a} is loaded
## using the @code{load} function.  An example of the use of @code{saveobj}
## might be to add fields to an object that don't make sense to be saved.
## For example:
##
## @example
## @group
## function b = loadobj (a)
##   b = a;
##   b.addmissingfield = addfield (b);
## endfunction
## @end group
## @end example
##
## @seealso{saveobj, class}
## @end deftypefn

function b = loadobj (a)
  error ("loadobj: not defined for class \"%s\"", class(a));
endfunction
