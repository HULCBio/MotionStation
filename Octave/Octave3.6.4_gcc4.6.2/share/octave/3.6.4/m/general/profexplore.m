## This is the worker function.  tree is the current subtree we want to
## display / explore.  parents is a string containing the already 'rendered'
## data for the parents which is displayed on top of the list of current
## children.  prefix is the prefix to add to each line rendered; this
## is just a string of spaces to get indentation right.
##
## Returning 0 indicates that the user requested to totally exit the
## explorer, thus also all higher levels should exit immediately.  An integer
## greater zero indicates to exit that many levels since the user wants to go
## up (but not necessarily quit).
