## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{b} =} saveobj (@var{a})
## Method of a class to manipulate an object prior to saving it to a file.
## The function @code{saveobj} is called when the object @var{a} is saved
## using the @code{save} function.  An example of the use of @code{saveobj}
## might be to remove fields of the object that don't make sense to be saved
## or it might be used to ensure that certain fields of the object are
## initialized before the object is saved.  For example:
##
## @example
## @group
## function b = saveobj (a)
##   b = a;
##   if (isempty (b.field))
##      b.field = initfield (b);
##   endif
## endfunction
## @end group
## @end example
##
## @seealso{loadobj, class}
## @end deftypefn

function b = saveobj (a)
  error ("saveobj: not defined for class \"%s\"", class(a));
endfunction
