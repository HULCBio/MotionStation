## @deftypefnx {Function File} {} poly (@var{x})
## If @var{A} is a square @math{N}-by-@math{N} matrix, @code{poly (@var{A})}
## is the row vector of the coefficients of @code{det (z * eye (N) - A)},
## the characteristic polynomial of @var{A}.  For example,
## the following code finds the eigenvalues of @var{A} which are the roots of
## @code{poly (@var{A})}.
##
## @example
## @group
## roots (poly (eye (3)))
##     @result{} 1.00001 + 0.00001i
##        1.00001 - 0.00001i
##        0.99999 + 0.00000i
## @end group
## @end example
##
## In fact, all three eigenvalues are exactly 1 which emphasizes that for
## numerical performance the @code{eig} function should be used to compute
## eigenvalues.
##
## If @var{x} is a vector, @code{poly (@var{x})} is a vector of the
## coefficients of the polynomial whose roots are the elements of @var{x}. 
## That is, if @var{c} is a polynomial, then the elements of @code{@var{d} =
## roots (poly (@var{c}))} are contained in @var{c}.  The vectors @var{c} and
## @var{d} are not identical, however, due to sorting and numerical errors.
