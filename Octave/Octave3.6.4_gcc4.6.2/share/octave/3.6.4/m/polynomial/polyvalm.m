## @deftypefn {Function File} {} polyvalm (@var{c}, @var{x})
## Evaluate a polynomial in the matrix sense.
##
## @code{polyvalm (@var{c}, @var{x})} will evaluate the polynomial in the
## matrix sense, i.e., matrix multiplication is used instead of element by
## element multiplication as used in @code{polyval}.
##
## The argument @var{x} must be a square matrix.
