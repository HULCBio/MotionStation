## Suspend program execution until the figure with handle @var{h} is
## deleted or @code{uiresume} is called.  When no figure handle is specified,
## this function uses the current figure.
##
## If the figure handle is invalid or there is no current figure, this
## functions returns immediately.
##
## When specified, @var{timeout} defines the number of seconds to wait
## for the figure deletion or the @code{uiresume} call.  The timeout value
## must be at least 1. If a smaller value is specified, a warning is issued
## and a timeout value of 1 is used instead.  If a non-integer value is
## specified, it is truncated towards 0. If @var{timeout} is not specified,
## the program execution is suspended indefinitely.
