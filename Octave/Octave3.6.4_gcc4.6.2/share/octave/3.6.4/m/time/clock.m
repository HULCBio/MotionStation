## @deftypefn {Function File} {} clock ()
## Return the current local date and time as a date vector.  The date vector
## contains the following fields: current year, month (1-12), day (1-31),
## hour (0-23), minute (0-59), and second (0-61).  The seconds field has
## a fractional part after the decimal point for extended accuracy.
##
## For example:
##
## @example
## @group
## fix (clock ())
##      @result{} [ 1993, 8, 20, 4, 56, 1 ]
## @end group
## @end example
##
## The function clock is more accurate on systems that have the
## @code{gettimeofday} function.
