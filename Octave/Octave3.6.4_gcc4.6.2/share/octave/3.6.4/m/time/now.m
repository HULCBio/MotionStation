## The fractional part, @code{rem (now, 1)} corresponds to the current

  ## The following doesn't work (e.g., one hour off on 2005-10-04):
  ##
  ##   seconds since 1970-1-1 corrected by seconds from GMT to local time
  ##   divided by 86400 sec/day plus day num for 1970-1-1
  ##   t = (time - mktime(gmtime(0)))/86400 + 719529;
  ##
  ## mktime(gmtime(0)) does indeed return the offset from Greenwich to the
  ## local time zone, but we need to account for daylight savings time
  ## changing by an hour the offset from CUT for part of the year.
