## @deftypefn {Function File} {} asctime (@var{tm_struct})
## Convert a time structure to a string using the following 
## format: "ddd mmm mm HH:MM:SS yyyy".  For example:
##
## @example
## @group
## asctime (localtime (time ()))
##      @result{} "Mon Feb 17 01:15:06 1997"
## @end group
## @end example
##
## This is equivalent to @code{ctime (time ())}.
