## @deftypefn {Function File} {} ctime (@var{t})
## Convert a value returned from @code{time} (or any other non-negative
## integer), to the local time and return a string of the same form as
## @code{asctime}.  The function @code{ctime (time)} is equivalent to
## @code{asctime (localtime (time))}.  For example:
##
## @example
## @group
## ctime (time ())
##    @result{} "Mon Feb 17 01:15:06 1997"
## @end group
## @end example
## @seealso{asctime, time, localtime}
## @end deftypefn
