## @deftypefn {Function File} {} vech (@var{x})
## Return the vector obtained by eliminating all supradiagonal elements of
## the square matrix @var{x} and stacking the result one column above the
## other.  This has uses in matrix calculus where the underlying matrix
## is symmetric and it would be pointless to keep values above the main
## diagonal.
