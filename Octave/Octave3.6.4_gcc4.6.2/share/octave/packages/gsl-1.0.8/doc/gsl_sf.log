./gsl_sf.texi:840: Use of \ doesn't match its definition.
l.840 function of order n, \\
                             exp(-|x|) I_n(x)
If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.

./gsl_sf.texi:2790: Use of \ doesn't match its definition.
l.2790 function of order n, \\
                              exp(-|x|) I_n(x)
If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.
