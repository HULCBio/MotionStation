./gsl.texi:840: Use of \ doesn't match its definition.
l.840 function of order n, \\
                             exp(-|x|) I_n(x)
If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.

l.2720 function of order n, \\
                              exp(-|x|) I_n(x)
If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.

followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.
