	Differences from Matlab version:
	- In src/existfile.c, comment out #include <matrix.h>, because compiler cannot 
	  find this file.
	- Add multicoredemo_octave.m to demonstrate the possible functionalities with
	  Octave
	- Add testfunc_octave, because condest() and rcond() are not available on 
	  Octave-2.9.16

Problems with Octave-2.9.16:
- A secondary octave process created by popen() or popen2()cannot be closed
  by pclose(). If closed by kill(), it still doesn't close completely. 
  Instead it becomes a zombie process with zero memory usage. When the main 
  Octave process exits, the zombie ones disappear.
- Sometimes, during the running there are warnings like this:
	warning: broken pipe -- some output may be lost
	
Compatibility problem with Octave-2.9.16:	
- On Octave for Linux, even in --traditional mode (Matlab compatible mode):
	octave:10> fullfile('','filename')
	ans = ./filename
  Matlab 7 for Linux and Windows:
	>> fullfile('','filename')
	ans =
	filename
