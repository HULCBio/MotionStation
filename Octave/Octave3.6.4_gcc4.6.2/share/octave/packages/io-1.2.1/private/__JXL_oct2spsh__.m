## Author: Philip Nienhuis
## Created: 2009-12-04
## Updates:
## 2009-12-11
## 2010-01-12 Fixed skipping empty array values (now Excel-conformant => cell cleared)
##            Added xls.changed = 1 statement to signal successful write
## 2010-07-27 Added formula writing support (based on POI patch by Benjamin Lindner)
##            Added check for valid file pointer struct
## 2010-08-01 Improved try-catch for formulas to enter wrong formulas as text strings
## 2010-08-01 Added range vs. array size vs. capacity checks
##     ''     Code cleanup
##     ''     Changed topleft arg into range arg (topleft version still recognized)
## 2010-08-03 Moved range checks and cell type parsing to separate routines
## 2010-08-11 Moved addcell() into try-catch as it is addCell which throws fatal errors
## 2010-10-20 Improved logic for tracking file changes (xls.changed 2 or 3); dropped
##     ''      internal variable 'changed'
## 2010-10-27 File change tracking again refined
## 2010-11-12 Moved ptr struct check into main func
## 2012-01-26 Fixed "seealso" help string
## 2012-02-27 Copyright strings updated
## 2012-05-21 "Double" cast added when writing numeric values
## 2012-05-21 "Double" cast moved into main func oct2xls
## 2012-10-12 Renamed & moved into ./private
## 2012-10-24 Style fixes
## 2013-01-20 Adapted to ML-compatible Java calls
