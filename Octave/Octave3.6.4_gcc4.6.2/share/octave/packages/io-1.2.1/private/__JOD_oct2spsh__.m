## __JOD_oct2spsh__ - write data from octave to an ODS spreadsheet using the
## jOpenDocument interface.
##
## Author: Philip Nienhuis
## Created: 2009-12-13
## First usable version: 2010-01-14
## Updates:
## 2010-03-17 Adapted to simplified calccelladdress argument list
## 2010-04-24 Added ensureColumnCount & ensureRowCount
##            Fixed a few bugs with top row & left column indexes
##            Fixed a number of other stupid bugs
##            Added check on NaN before assigning data value to sprdsh-cell
## 2010-06-01 Checked logic. AFAICS all should work with upcoming jOpenDocument 1.2b4;
##            in 1.2b3 adding a newsheet always leaves an incomplete upper row;
##            supposedly (hopefully) that will be fixed in 1.2b4.
##     ''     Added check for jOpenDocument version. Adding sheets only works for
##            1.2b3+ (barring bug above)
## 2010-06-02 Fixed first sheet remaining in new spreadsheets
## 2010-08-01 Added option for crange to be only topleft cell address
##     ''     Code cleanup
## 2010-08-13 Fixed bug of ignoring text sheet name in case of new spreadsheet
## 2010-08-15 Fixed bug with invalid first sheet in new spreadsheets
## 2010-10-27 Improved file change tracking tru ods.changed
## 2010-11-12 Improved file change tracking tru ods.changed
## 2012-02-26 Write logicals as doubles (bug in jOpenDocument, would write as text)
## 2012-10-12 Renamed & moved into ./private
## 2012-10-24 Style fixes
