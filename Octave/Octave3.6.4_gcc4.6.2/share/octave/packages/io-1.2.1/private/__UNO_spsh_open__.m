## __UNO_xlsopen__ - Internal function for opening a spreadsheet file using Java / OOo/LO UNO

## Author: Philip Nienhuis <prnienhuis@users.sf.net>
## Created: 2012-10-07
## Updates (possibly from xlsopen):
## 2011-05-18 Experimental UNO support added, incl. creating new spreadsheets
## 2012-09-02 (in UNO section) web adresses need only two consecutive slashes
## 2012-09-03 (in UNO section) replace canonicalize_file_name on non-Windows to
##            make_absolute_filename (see bug #36677)
## 2012-10-24 Style fixes
## 2013-01-20 Adapted to ML-compatible Java calls

    ## First, the file name must be transformed into a URL
    if (~isempty (strmatch ("file:///", filename)) || ~isempty (strmatch ("http://", filename))...

      ## Seems in proper shape for OOo (at first sight)
    else
      ## Transform into URL form. 
      ## FIXME make_absolute_filename() doesn't work across drive(-letters) so
      ##       until it is fixed we'll fall back on canonicalize_file_name() there
