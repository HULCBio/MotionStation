## __COM_xlsopen.m__ - Internal function for opening an xls(x) file using COM/ActiveX

## Author: Philip <Philip@DESKPRN>
## Created: 2012-10-07
## Updates (possibly from xlsopen):
## 2010-11-01 Added <COM>.Application.DisplayAlerts=0 in COM section to avoid Excel pop-ups
## 2012-10-24 Style fixes

function [ xls, xlssupport, lastintf ] = __COM_spsh_open__ (xls, xwrite, filename, xlssupport)

    app = actxserver ("Excel.Application");
    try      ## Because Excel itself can still crash on file formats etc.
      app.Application.DisplayAlerts = 0;
      if (xwrite < 2)
        ## Open workbook
        wb = app.Workbooks.Open (canonicalize_file_name (filename));
      elseif (xwrite > 2)
        ## Create a new workbook
        wb = app.Workbooks.Add ();
        ## Uncommenting the below statement can be useful in multi-user environments.
        ## Be sure to uncomment correspondig stanza in xlsclose to avoid zombie Excels
        ## wb.SaveAs (canonicalize_file_name (filename))
      endif
      xls.app = app;
      xls.xtype = "COM";
      xls.workbook = wb;
      xls.filename = filename;
      xlssupport += 1;
      lastintf = "COM";
    catch
      warning ( sprintf ("ActiveX error trying to open or create file %s\n",...
                         filename));
      app.Application.DisplayAlerts = 1;
      app.Quit ();
      delete (app);
