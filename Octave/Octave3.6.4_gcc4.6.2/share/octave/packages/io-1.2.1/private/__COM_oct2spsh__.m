## Author: Philip Nienhuis  (originally based on mat2xls by Michael Goffioul)
## Rewritten: 2009-09-26
## Updates:
## 2009-12-11
## 2010-01-12 Fixed typearr sorting out (was only 1-dim & braces rather than parens))
##            Set cells corresponding to empty array cells empty (cf. Matlab)
## 2010-01-13 Removed an extraneous statement used for debugging 
##            I plan look at it when octave v.3.4 is about to arrive.
## 2010-08-01 Added checks for input array size vs check on capacity
##     ''     Changed topleft arg into range arg (just topleft still recognized)
##     ''     Some code cleanup
##     ''     Added option for formula input as text string
## 2010-08-01 Added range vs. array size vs. capacity checks
## 2010-08-03 Moved range checks and type array parsing to separate functions
## 2010-10-20 Bug fix removing new empty sheets in new workbook that haven't been 
##            created in the first place due to Excel setting (thanks Ian Journeaux)
##     ''     Changed range use in COM transfer call
## 2010-10-21 Improved file change tracking (var xls.changed)
## 2010-10-24 Fixed bug introduced in above fix: for loops have no stride param,
##     ''     replaced by while loop
##     ''     Added check for "live" ActiveX server
## 2010-11-12 Moved ptr struct check into main func
## 2012-01-26 Fixed "seealso" help string
## 2012-02-27 Copyright strings updated
## 2012-10-12 Renamed & moved into ./private
## 2012-10-24 Style fixes
## 2012-12-21 Search for exact match when searching sheet names
