          SolveFrame(JOINTS, MEMBERS, NODELOADS, DIST, POINT)
     Solves a 2D frame with the matrix displacement method for the
     following input parameters:

     joints = [x , y, constraints ; ...]

     constraints=[x , y, rotation] free=0, supported=1

     members = [nodeN, nodeF, E, I, A; ...]

     nodeloads = [node, Fx, Fy, Mz; ...]

     loads on members:

     dist = [membernum,FxN,FyN,FxF,FyF,a,b,local ; ...] for distributed
     loads    where FxN and FyN are the loads on distance a from the
     near node    (same with far node and distance b)    local=1 if
     loads are on local axis, 0 if global

     point = [membernum,Fx,Fy,a,local; ...]     where Fx and Fy are the
     loads on distance a from the node near    local=1 if loads are on
     local axis, 0 if global

     Output is formated as follows (rownumber corresponds to    node or
     member number):

     Reactions = [Fx,Fy,Mz;...] where NaN if it was a non supported dof

     Displacements = [x,y,rotation;...]

     MemF = [FxN, FyN, MzN, FxF, FyF, MzF; ...]
