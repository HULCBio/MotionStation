## F = sgolay (p, n [, m [, ts]])
##   Computes the filter coefficients for all Savitzsky-Golay smoothing
##   filters of order p for length n (odd). m can be used in order to
##   get directly the mth derivative. In this case, ts is a scaling factor. 
##
## The early rows of F smooth based on future values and later rows
## smooth based on past values, with the middle row using half future
## and half past.  In particular, you can use row i to estimate x(k)
## based on the i-1 preceding values and the n-i following values of x
## values as y(k) = F(i,:) * x(k-i+1:k+n-i).
##
## Normally, you would apply the first (n-1)/2 rows to the first k
## points of the vector, the last k rows to the last k points of the
## vector and middle row to the remainder, but for example if you were
## running on a realtime system where you wanted to smooth based on the
## all the data collected up to the current time, with a lag of five
## samples, you could apply just the filter on row n-5 to your window
## of length n each time you added a new sample.
