## Usage:  qp_kaiser (nb, at, linear)
##
## Computes a finite impulse response (FIR) filter for use with a
## quasi-perfect reconstruction polyphase-network filter bank. This
## version utilizes a Kaiser window to shape the frequency response of
## the designed filter. Tha number nb of bands and the desired
## attenuation at in the stop-band are given as parameters.
##
## The Kaiser window is multiplied by the ideal impulse response
## h(n)=a.sinc(a.n) and converted to its minimum-phase version by means
## of a Hilbert transform.
##
## By using a third non-null argument, the minimum-phase calculation is
## ommited at all.
