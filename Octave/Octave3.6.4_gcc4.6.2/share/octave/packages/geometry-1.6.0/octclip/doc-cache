     This function performs boolean operations between two polygons
     using the Greiner-Hormann algorithm
     (http://davis.wpi.edu/~matt/courses/clipping/).

     SUB is a two column matrix containing the X and Y coordinates of
     the vertices for the subject polygon.

     CLIP is a two column matrix containing the X and Y coordinates of
     the vertices for the clipper polygon.

     OP is a text string containing the operation to perform between
     SUB and CLIP. Possible values are:

        * 'AND' Intersection of SUB and CLIP (value by default).

        * 'OR' Union of SUBT and CLIP.

        * 'AB' Operation SUB - CLIP.

        * 'BA' Operation of CLIP - SUB.

     For the matrices SUB and CLIP, the first point is not needed to be
     repeated at the end (but is permitted). Pairs of (NaN,NaN)
     coordinates in SUB and/or CLIP are ommitted.

     X is a column vector containing the X coordinates of the vertices
     of the resultant polygon(s).

     Y is a column vector containing the Y coordinates of the vertices
     of the resultant polygon(s).

     NPOL is the number of output polygons.

     NINT is the number of intersections between SUB and CLIP.

     NPERT is the number of perturbed points of the CLIP polygon in any
     particular case (points in the oborder of the other polygon)
     occurs see http://davis.wpi.edu/~matt/courses/clipping/ for
     details.
