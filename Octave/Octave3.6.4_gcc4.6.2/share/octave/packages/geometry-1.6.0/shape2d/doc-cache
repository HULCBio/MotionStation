 -- Function File: POLYLINE =  curve2polyline (CURVE)
 -- Function File: POLYLINE =  curve2polyline (...,PROPERTY,VALUE,...)
     Adaptive sampling of a parametric curve.

     The CURVE is described as a 2-by-N matrix. Rows correspond to the
     polynomial (compatible with `polyval') describing the respective
     component of the curve. The curve must be parametrized in the
     interval [0,1].  The vertices of the polyline are accumulated in
     regions of the curve where the curvature is higher.

     *Parameters*
    `'Nmax''
          Maximum number of vertices. Not used.

    `'Tol''
          Tolerance for the error criteria. Default value `1e-4'.

    `'MaxIter''
          Maximum number of iterations. Default value `10'.

    `'Method''
          Not implemented.

 -- Function File: POLYGON =  shape2polygon (SHAPE)
 -- Function File: POLYGON =  shape2polygon (...,PROPERTY,VALUE,...)
     Transforms a 2D shape described by piecewise smooth polynomials
     into a polygon.

     SHAPE is a n-by-1 cell where each element is a pair of polynomials
     compatible with polyval.  POLYGON is a k-by-2 matrix, where each
     row represents a vertex.  The property-value pairs are passed to
     `curve2polyline'.

 -- Function File:  A = shapearea (PP)
     Calculate the area of a 2D shape defined with piecewise smooth
     polynomials.

     Shape is defined with piecewise smooth polynomials. PP is a cell
     where each elements is a 2-by-(poly_degree+1) array containing a
     pair of polynomials.

     `px(i,:) = pp{i}(1,:)' and `py(i,:) = pp{i}(2,:)'.

# name: <cell-element>
# type: sq_string

 -- Function File:  CM = shapecentroid (PP)
     Centroid of a simple plane shape defined with piecewise smooth
     polynomials.

     The shape is defined with piecewise smooth polynomials. PP is a
     cell where each elements is a 2-by-(poly_degree+1) matrix
     containing a pair of polynomials.  `px(i,:) = pp{i}(1,:)' and
     `py(i,:) = pp{i}(2,:)'.

     The edges of the shape should not self-intersect. This function
     does not check for the sanity of the shape.

     Pots a 2D shape defined by piecewise smooth polynomials in the
     current axis.

     PP is a cell where each elements is a 2-by-(poly_degree+1) matrix
     containing a pair of polynomials.  N is the number of points to be
     used in non-straight edges.  Additional parameter value pairs are
     passed to `drawPolygon'.
