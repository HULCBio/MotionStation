Title: Nonlinear Lifting Line for Wings 
Maintainer: Jaroslav Hajek <highegg@gmail.com>
Description: This package allows efficient computation of nonlinear aerodynamic
properties of a wing. It employs 2D section data to build a 3D potential vortex
model of the flow. It uses a robust Euler-Newton method to track the change of
flow vorticity quantities as the angle of attack progresses.
