The directory nnet/doc contains two subdirectories.
1. latex: This includes five (5) subdirectories. All of them
          are used to create the newest version of the documentation.
          
		  asymptote: Includes asy-scripts to create graphics, used in
          subdirectory users/octave/neuroToolbox/graphics. For pdf output
          the graphic files must be in pdf format. For dvi output, the
          graphics must be in eps format. That's why I create each time
          both types. Used asymptote is version: 1.42 win version
          
          common: Contains some .tex files which are used in both documentations.
          developer as users guide.
          
          developers: Contains .tex files with a lot of informations about 
          how I did the most parts of this package. Not all of them are
          completly written ... :-(
          
          perl:  Contains two files. The first one is a "modul" to put somewhere
          in a lib directory in the perl installation. This file ends with .pm.
          The second file (createTestDocu.pl) is a short perl script to generate
		  some .tex files for the developer guide which contains all the test
		  cases programmed in the function files. In the file createTestDocu.pl
		  must be changed some variables to the local system likewise it must be
		  copied to the "developers" directory!

          users: The user's guide. The official documentation to the neural network
          package!

2. pdf:  Contains documentation generated of the latex directory.
