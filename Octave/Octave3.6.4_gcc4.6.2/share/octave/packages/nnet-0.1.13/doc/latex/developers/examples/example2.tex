\section{Example 2}

This MLP is designed with 26-2-1. Why starting easy if it's possible to start difficult?
The input matrix which will be given to the training algorithm has the dimension of 26x71. The jacobian matrix should reach a size of 71x57.

\subsection{Weight matrices}
The first layer matrix will hold 2x26 weights. The second layer matrix will hold 1x2 weights.
The first bias holds 26x1 weights and the second holds only a scalar element.

\subsection{Sensitivity Matrices}
This part is right now not so clear in my mind. What is the dimension of these two matrices?
The first layer sensitivity matrix should be about 2x71. Number of hidden neurons in the rows and number of train data sets in the columns.\\

In the actual version, the dimension is about 71x71 .. so it seems to have a mistake inside the algorithm :-(
