\section{Code convention}

The main function of this toolbox will be programed with help of the book in \cite{4}.
So the variables will have the same names like in the book with one exception: Variables, only with one letter, will have two letters, e.g. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $X \rightarrow Xx$
	\item $Q \rightarrow Qq$
	\item $a \rightarrow aa$
\end{itemize}
and so on ...\\

This is only to make it possible to search for variable names.
