\section{Compatibility to Matlab's \texttrademark Neural Network Toolbox}
The compatibility is one of the strongest targets during developing this toolbox.
If I have to develope an incompatibility e.g. in naming the functions, it will be descriped
in this documentation. Even though it should be clear that I can't make a one to one copy.  First,
the m-files are copyrighted and second, octave doesn't yet support the object oriented-programming techonology.\\

If you find a bug, any not described incompatibility or have some suggestions, please write me at
michaelschmid@users.sourceforge.net. This will help improving this toolbox.
