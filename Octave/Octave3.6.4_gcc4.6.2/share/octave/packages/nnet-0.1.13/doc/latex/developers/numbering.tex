\section{Version numbers of the neural network toolbox}

The first number describes the major release. Version number V1.0 will be the first toolbox release which should have the same functions like the Matlab R14 SP3 neural network Toolbox.\\

The second number defines the finished functions. So to start, only the MLPs will realised and so this will be the number V0.1.0.\\

The third number defines the status of the actual development and function. V0.0.1 means no release with MLP, actually, everything under construction... ;-D.\\

Right now it's version V0.1.3 which means MLP works and currently the transfer function logsig is added.
