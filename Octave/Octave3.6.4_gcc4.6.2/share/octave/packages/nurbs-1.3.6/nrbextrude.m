function srf = nrbextrude(curve,vector)

%
% NRBEXTRUDE: Construct a NURBS surface by extruding a NURBS curve, or 
%  construct a NURBS volume by extruding a NURBS surface.
% 
% Calling Sequence:
% 
%   srf = nrbextrude(crv,vec);
% 
% INPUT:
% 
%   crv		: NURBS curve or surface to extrude, see nrbmak.
% 
%   vec		: Vector along which the entity is extruded.
%
% OUTPUT: 
% 
%   srf		: NURBS surface or volume constructed.
% 
% Description:
% 
%   Constructs either a NURBS surface by extruding a NURBS curve along a  
%   defined vector, or a NURBS volume by extruding a NURBS surface. In the 
%   first case, the NURBS curve forms the U direction of the surface edge, and
%   is extruded along the vector in the V direction. In the second case, the 
%   original surface forms the U and V direction of the volume, and is extruded
%   along the W direction.
%
% Examples:
% 
%   Form a hollow cylinder by extruding a circle along the z-axis.
%
%   srf = nrbextrude(nrbcirc, [0,0,1]);
