% 
% VECTRANS: Transformation matrix for a translation.
% 
% Calling Sequence:
% 
%   st = vectrans(tvec)
% 
% INPUT:
% 
%   tvec	: A vectors defining the translation along the x,y and
%                   z axes. i.e. [tx, ty, ty]
%
% OUTPUT:
% 
%   st		: Translation Transformation Matrix
% 
% Description:
% 
%   Returns a (4x4) Transformation matrix for translation.
% 
%   The matrix is:
% 
%         [ 1   0   0   tx ]
%         [ 0   1   0   ty ]
%         [ 0   0   1   tz ]
%         [ 0   0   0   1  ]
% 
% Examples:
% 
%   Translate the NURBS line (0.0,0.0,0.0) - (1.0,1.0,1.0) by 3 along
%   the x-axis, 2 along the y-axis and 4 along the z-axis.
%
%   line = nrbline([0.0 0.0 0.0],[1.0 1.0 1.0]);
%   trans = vectrans([3.0 2.0 4.0]);
%   tline = nrbtform(line, trans);
