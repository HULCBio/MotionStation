2008/05: Possibility of plotting a label with each data point in g_ez, either w/
      e.g. g_ez ("plot", rand(5,2), {"Label 1","Label 2", "3", "X", "Y"}) or w/
      g_ez ("plot", rand(10,2), "#") or 
      g_ez (plot", rand(10,2), "-o#4;Random Points;")

      g = g_plot (g) saves the locations of double-clicks and middle button
      clicks in  g.double_clicks and g.middle_clicks.
