## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{rval} =} cstrcmp (@var{s1}, @var{s2})
## Compare strings @var{s1} and @var{s2} like the C function.
##
## Aside the difference to the return values, this function API is exactly the
## same as Octave's @code{strcmp} and will accept cell arrays as well.
##
## @var{rval} indicates the relationship between the strings:
## @itemize @bullet
## @item
## A value of 0 indicates that both strings are equal;
## @item
## A value of +1 indicates that the first character that does not match has a
## greater value in @var{s1} than in @var{s2}.
## @item
## A value of -1 indicates that the first character that does not match has a
## match has a smaller value in @var{s1} than in @var{s2}.
## @end itemize
##
## @example
## @group
## cstrcmp("marry","marry")
##       @result{}  0
## cstrcmp("marry","marri")
##       @result{} +1
## cstrcmp("marri","marry")
##       @result{} -1
## @end group
## @end example

## @seealso {strcmp, strcmpi}

  ## this function is just like Octave's strcmp but the 0 and 1 need to be
  ## inverted. Once is done, if there are 1, we need to decide if they will
  ## be positive or negative. Also, since it's possible that the value needs
  ## to be negative, class must be double (strcmp returns logical)

  ##  - arrays have same length (even if it's only one cell)
  ##  - arrays have different lengths (in which case, one will have a single cell)
