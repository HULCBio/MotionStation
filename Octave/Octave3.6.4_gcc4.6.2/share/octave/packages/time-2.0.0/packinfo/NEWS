Summary of important user-visible changes for time 2.0.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** VERY IMPORTANT: the time package has been removed. All its functions
    have been moved to the financial package (23 of its 25 functions are
    part of Matlab's financial toolbox). To avoid transition problems, this
    new release is merely a dummy package with no functions, and dependent
    on the new version of the financial package.

 ** The function `datesplit' (now part of the financial package) has been
    deprecated in favour of `datevec' from Octave-core.

 ** Package is no longer automatically loaded.
