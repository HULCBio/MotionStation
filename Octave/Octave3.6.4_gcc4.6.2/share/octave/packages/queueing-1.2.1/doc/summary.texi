@node About the Queueing Toolbox
@section About the Queueing Toolbox

This document describes the @code{queueing} toolbox for GNU Octave
(@code{queueing} in short). The @code{queueing} toolbox, previously
known as @code{qnetworks}, is a collection of functions written in GNU
Octave for analyzing queueing networks and Markov
chains. Specifically, @code{queueing} contains functions for analyzing
Jackson networks, open, closed or mixed product-form BCMP networks,
and computation of performance bounds. The following algorithms have
been implemented

@itemize

@item Convolution for closed, single-class product-form networks
with load-dependent service centers;

@item Exact and approximate Mean Value Analysis (MVA) for single and
multiple class product-form closed networks;

@item MVA for mixed, multiple class product-form networks
with load-independent service centers;

@item Approximate MVA for closed, single-class networks with blocking
(MVABLO algorithm by F. Akyildiz);

@item Asymptotic Bounds, Balanced System Bounds and Geometric Bounds;

@end itemize

@noindent @code{queueing} 
provides functions for analyzing the following kind of single-station
queueing systems:

@itemize

@item @math{M/M/1}
@item @math{M/M/m}
@item @math{M/M/\infty}
@item @math{M/M/1/k} single-server, finite capacity system
@item @math{M/M/m/k} multiple-server, finite capacity system
@item Asymmetric @math{M/M/m}
@item @math{M/G/1} (general service time distribution)
@item @math{M/H_m/1} (Hyperexponential service time distribution)
@end itemize

Functions for Markov chain analysis are also provided:

@itemize

@item Birth-death process;
@item Transient and steady-state occupancy probabilities;
@item Mean times to absorption;
@item Expected sojourn times and time-averaged sojourn times;
@item Mean first passage times;

@end itemize

General Public License (GPL), version 3 or later

@node Contributing Guidelines
@section Contributing Guidelines

Contributions and bug reports are @emph{always} welcome. If you want
to contribute to the @code{queueing} package, here are some
guidelines:

@itemize

@item If you are contributing a new function, please embed proper
documentation within the function itself. The documentation must be in
@code{texinfo} format, so that it can be extracted and formatted into
the printable manual. See the existing functions of the
@code{queueing} package for the documentation style.

@item Make sure that each new function 
properly checks the validity of its input parameters. For example,
each function accepting vectors should check whether the dimensions
match.

@item Provide bibliographic references for each new algorithm you 
contribute. If your implementation differs in some way from the
reference you give, please describe how and why your implementation
differs. Add references to the @file{doc/references.txi} file.

@item Include test and demo blocks with your code.
Test blocks are particularly important, since most algorithms tend to
be quite tricky to implement correctly. If appropriate, test blocks
should also verify that the function fails on incorrect input
parameters.

@end itemize

Send your contribution to Moreno Marzolla
(@email{marzolla@@cs.unibo.it}). If you are just a user of this
package and find it useful, let me know by dropping me a line. Thanks.
