The queueing toolbox ("queueing", in short) is a collection of GNU
Octave scripts for numerical evaluation of queueing network
models. Open, closed and mixed networks are supported, with single or
multiple classes of customers. The queueing toolbox also provides
functions for steady-state and transient analysis of Markov chains, as
well as for single station queueing systems.
