1 Installation and Getting Started
**********************************

1.1 Installation through Octave package management system
=========================================================

The most recent version of `queueing' is 1.2.1 and can be downloaded
from Octave-Forge

   `http://octave.sourceforge.net/queueing/'

   Additional information can be found at

   `http://www.moreno.marzolla.name/software/queueing/'

   To install `queueing', follow these steps:

  1. If you have a recent version of GNU Octave and a network
     connection, you can install `queueing' directly from Octave
     command prompt using this command:

          octave:1> pkg install -forge queueing

     The command above will automaticall download and install the latest
     version of the queueing toolbox from Octave Forge, and install it
     on your machine.

     If you do not have root access, you can do a local install using:

          octave:1> pkg install -local -forge queueing

     This will install `queueing' within your home directory, and the
     package will be available to your user only.

  2. Alternatively, you can first download `queueing' from
     Octave-Forge; then, to install the package in the system-wide
     location issue this command at the Octave prompt:

          octave:1> pkg install _queueing-1.2.1.tar.gz_

     (you may need to start Octave as root in order to allow the
     installation to copy the files to the target locations). After
     this, all functions will be readily available each time Octave
     starts, without the need to tweak the search path.

     If you do not have root access, you can do a local install using:

          octave:1> pkg install -local queueing-1.2.1.tar.gz

          Note: Octave version 3.2.3 as shipped with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
          seems to ignore `-local' and always tries to install the
          package on the system directory.

  3. Verify that the package is indeed installed using the `pkg list'
     command at the Octave prompt; after succesfull installation you
     should see something like that:

          octave:1>pkg list queueing
          Package Name  | Version | Installation directory
          --------------+---------+-----------------------
              queueing  |   1.2.1 | /home/moreno/octave/queueing-1.2.1

  4. Starting from version 1.1.1, `queueing' is no longer automatically
     loaded on Octave startup. To make the functions available for use,
     you need to issue the command

          octave:1>pkg load queueing

     at the Octave prompt. To automatically load `queueing' each time
     Octave starts, you can add the command above to the startup script
     (usually, `~/.octaverc' on Unix systems).

  5. To completely remove `queueing' from your system, use the `pkg
     uninstall' command:

          octave:1> pkg uninstall queueing


1.2 Manual installation
=======================

If you want to manually install `queueing' in a custom location, you
can download the tarball and unpack it somewhere:

     tar xvfz queueing-1.2.1.tar.gz
     cd queueing-1.2.1/queueing/

   Copy all `.m' files from the `inst/' directory to some target
location. Then, start Octave with the `-p' option to add the target
location to the search path, so that Octave will find all `queueing'
functions automatically:

     octave -p _/path/to/queueing_

   For example, if all `queueing' m-files are in `/usr/local/queueing',
you can start Octave as follows:

     octave -p _/usr/local/queueing_

   If you want, you can add the following line to `~/.octaverc':

     addpath("_/path/to/queueing_");

so that the path `/path/to/queueing' is automatically added to the
search path each time Octave is started, and you no longer need to
specify the `-p' option on the command line.
