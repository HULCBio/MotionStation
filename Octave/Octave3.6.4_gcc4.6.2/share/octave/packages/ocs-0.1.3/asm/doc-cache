 -- Function File: [A,JAC,RES] = asm_build_system(INSTRUCT,X,T)
     Cycle through the circuit description structure INSTRUCT to build
     the system matrices A, JAC, RES for the current step of the Newton
     method.

     X is the current value of the state variables, while T is the
     current time point.

     See the `IFF file format specifications' for details about the
     output matrices.

 -- Function File: [A,B,C] = asm_initialize_system(INSTRUCT,X)
     Cycle through the circuit description structure INSTRUCT to build
     the system matrices A, B, C for the linear and time-invariant part
     of the system.

     X is the current value of the state variables.

     See the `IFF file format specifications' for details about the
     output matrices.
