 -- Function File: [Y,NUMIT,RESNRM] = nls_newton_raphson
          (Y0,RES,JAC,TOL, MAXIT,VERBOSITY,UPDATE);
     Solve a non-linear system of equations using the Newton-Raphson
     method with damping and return the computed solution vector Y.

     The initial guess for the algorithm is set to Y0.

     The Jacobian and residual at each step are computed via the
     function handles RES and JAC.

     The variables TOL and MAXIT are the relative tolerance on the
     error of the computed solution and the maximum number of
     iterations to be performed by the algorithm.

     The optional parameter VERBOSITY produce verbose output if
     non-zero.

     The optional function handle UPDATE may be used to provide a
     faster mean to update Jacobian and residual at runtime.

     NUMIT is the number of performed iterations while RESNRM is a
     vector containing the residual norm at each step.

 -- Function File: [OUT, NITER] = nls_stationary (INSTRUCT,X,TOL,MAXIT)
     Compute the stationary state solution OUT of the system described
     by INSTRUCT.

     X is the initial guess used by the Newton-Raphson algorithm
     implemented in `nls_newton_raphson', while TOL and MAXIT are the
     corresponding parameters.

     The optional output NITER returns the number of Newton iterations
     needed to reach convergence.
