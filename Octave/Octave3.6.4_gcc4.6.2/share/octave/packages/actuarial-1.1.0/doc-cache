 -- Function File: BF = bferguson (S, QUOTAS, ULTIMATE, K)
     Calculate the extended Bornhuetter-Ferguson method for reserves.
     BF provides a column vector with the elements of K-th period of
     development.  S is a mxn matrix that contains the run-off
     triangle, where m is the number of accident-years and n is the
     number of periods to final development. S may contain u = m-n
     complete years.  K may vary from 0 (first period) to n-1 (final
     period).

     The Bornhuetter-Ferguson predictors of the losses S(i,K) with i +
     K > n are defined as
          S(i,K)= S(i,n-i)+ (QUOTAS(K)- QUOTAS(n-i))* ULTIMATE(i)
