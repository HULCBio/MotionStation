## Performs a local 4D-optimal interpolation (objective analysis).
##
## Every elements in @var{f} corresponds to a data point (observation)
## at location  @var{x}, @var{y}, @var{z}, @var{t} with the error variance var
##
## @var{lenx},@var{leny},@var{lenz} and @var{lent} are correlation length in x-,y-,z-direction and time,
## respectively. 
## @var{m} represents the number of influential points.
##
## @var{xi},@var{yi},@var{zi} and @var{ti} are the data points where the field is
## interpolated. @var{fi} is the interpolated field and @var{vari} is 
## its error variance.
##
##
## The background field of the optimal interpolation is zero.
## For a different background field, the background field
## must be subtracted from the observation, the difference 
## is mapped by OI onto the background grid and finally the
## background is added back to the interpolated field.
##
## The error variance of the background field is assumed to 
## have a error variance of one.
