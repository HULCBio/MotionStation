 -- Loadable Function: [FI,VARI] = optiminterp1(X,F,VAR,LENX,M,XI)
     Performs a local 1D-optimal interpolation (objective analysis).

     Every elements in F corresponds to a data point (observation) at
     location X,Y with the error variance VAR.

     LENX is correlation length in x-direction.  M represents the
     number of influential points.

     XI is the data points where the field is interpolated. FI is the
     interpolated field and VARI is its error variance.

     The background field of the optimal interpolation is zero.  For a
     different background field, the background field must be
     subtracted from the observation, the difference is mapped by OI
     onto the background grid and finally the background is added back
     to the interpolated field.

     Performs a local 2D-optimal interpolation (objective analysis).

     Every elements in F corresponds to a data point (observation) at
     location X,Y with the error variance VAR.

     LENX and LENY are correlation length in x-direction and
     y-direction respectively.  M represents the number of influential
     points.

     is the interpolated field and VARI is its error variance.

     subtracted from the observation, the difference is mapped by OI
     onto the background grid and finally the background is added back
     to the interpolated field.  The error variance of the background
     field is assumed to have a error variance of one.
