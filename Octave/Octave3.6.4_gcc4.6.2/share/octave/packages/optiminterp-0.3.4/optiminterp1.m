## @deftypefn {Loadable Function} {[@var{fi},@var{vari}]} = optiminterp1(@var{x},@var{f},@var{var},@var{lenx},@var{m},@var{xi})
## Performs a local 1D-optimal interpolation (objective analysis).
##
## Every elements in @var{f} corresponds to a data point (observation)
## at location @var{x},@var{y} with the error variance @var{var}.
##
## @var{lenx} is correlation length in x-direction.
## @var{m} represents the number of influential points.
##
## @var{xi} is the data points where the field is
## interpolated. @var{fi} is the interpolated field and @var{vari} is 
## its error variance.
##
## The background field of the optimal interpolation is zero.
## For a different background field, the background field
## must be subtracted from the observation, the difference 
## is mapped by OI onto the background grid and finally the
## background is added back to the interpolated field.
