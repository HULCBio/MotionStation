 -- Function File:  lfdif (A, B, ALPHA, BETA, N)
     Approximate the solution of a boundary-value problem. The problem
     is defined as

           y''=p(x)*y' + q(x)*y + r(x), a<=x<=b, y(a)=alpha, y(b)=beta

     by the linear finite-diffence method. The inputs are

    a, b
          Endpoints

    alpha, beta
          boundary conditions

    n
          An integer value greater than or equal to 2
