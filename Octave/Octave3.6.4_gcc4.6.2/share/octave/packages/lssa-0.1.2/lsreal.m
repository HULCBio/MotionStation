## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{t} =} lsreal (@var{time}, @var{mag}, @var{maxfreq}, @var{numcoeff}, @var{numoctaves})
##
## Return a series of least-squares transforms of a real-valued time series.
## Each transform is minimized independently for each frequency.  The method
## used is a Lomb-Scargle transform of the real-valued (@var{time}, @var{mag})
## series, starting from frequency @var{maxfreq} and descending @var{numoctaves}
## octaves with @var{numcoeff} coefficients per octave.
##
## The result of the transform for each frequency is the coefficient of a sum of
## sine and cosine functions modified by that frequency, in the form of a
## complex numberâ€”where the cosine coefficient is encoded in the real term, and
## the sine coefficient is encoded in the imaginary term. Each frequency is fit
## independently from the others, and to minimize very low frequency error,
## consider storing the mean of a dataset with a constant or near-constant
## offset separately, and subtracting it from the dataset.
