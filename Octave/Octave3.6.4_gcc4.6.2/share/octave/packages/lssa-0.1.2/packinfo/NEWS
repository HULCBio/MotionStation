Summary of changes in lssa 0.1.2:

 ** All functions now have input checks in place to return useful errors as
    opposed to division by zero, etc.  Documentation has also been improved.

Summary of status of the intial lssa release, 0.1.1:

Current status:

 ** lscomplex and lsreal both produce accurate results; they can be slow for
    very large datasets.

 ** fastlscomplex is accurate for the first octave of results; there is still an
    error I need to pin down in the merging for additional octaves. fastlsreal
    is disabled at the moment as I move to an implementation based on the new
    fastlscomplex.

 ** lscorrcoeff works, although I'm still attempting to understand the initial
    author's reasoning. Its generated results are relevant to any given data
    set, but it does not appear to be normalized to any great extent.

 ** There are two wavelet functions under development, but they are not included
    in this release as they are currently not functional. For all your wavelet
    needs, the specific transformation used is available in the lswaveletcoeff
    function, and will generate a single cosine/sine magnitude pair (as a
    complex number) for a complex-valued series (this function may be joined by
    a companion for real-valued series) and can be looped to simulate a full
    wavelet transform.

 ** For all the working functions, tests have been written and formatted to
    Octave coding standards. These tests should pass on any given architecture
    (there was some question about that previously) and often provide examples
    of how the function operates. For a few functions, there are demo scripts.
