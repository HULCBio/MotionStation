.TH AURECORD 1 "Debian/GNU Linux"
.SH NAME
aurecord \- record audio signals at specified rate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aurecord -r rate -c channels -t time -e
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR aurecord (1)
is an internal command to the 
.B signalPAK
routines and is not intended for direct command-line use.

.BR aurecord (1)
records 
.I time
seconds of 
.I channels
channel audio at
.IR rate .
If the 
.I -e
option is specified, recording doesn't begin until there is a signal
to record, and stops when the signal ends, so it is great for
capturing a bit of speech without having to remove the surrounding
silence.

The data is written to stdout as:
.br
    4 byte rate (machine format)
.br
    4 byte number of channels (machine format) 
.br
    2 byte channel1 channel2 channel3 ... (machine format)
.br
    2 byte channel1 channel2 channel3 ... (machine format)
.br
    ...
.br
    2 byte channel1 channel2 channel3 ... (machine format)
