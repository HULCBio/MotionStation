Summary of important user-visible changes for vrml 1.0.13:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Credits: Thank you to CarnÃ« Draug <carandraug+dev@gmail.com> for explaining me the basics of the pkg system.

 ** The following functions are new:

      data2vrml
      checker_color
      vrml_Box
      vrml_Sphere
      vrml_parallelepiped
      vrml_Viewpoint

 ** The following functions have been removed:

      select_3D_points
      vrml_select_points

 ** Use of deprecated/removed functions have been fixed to work with later
    Octave releases.

 ** The function `vmesh' is now able to handle vectors

 ** Some bug fixes on the function `vrml_cyl' and `vrml_material' to handles
    colors correctly

 ** Package is no longer automatically loaded.

 ** The `linear-algebra' package is now a dependecy (altough not listed,
    previous releases of `vrml' were also dependent on it so this is a
    bugfix).
