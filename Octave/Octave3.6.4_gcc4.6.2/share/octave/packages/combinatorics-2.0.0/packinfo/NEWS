Summary of important user-visible changes for combinatorics 2.0.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** VERY IMPORTANT: the combinatorics package has been removed. Its
    integer partition functions have moved to miscellaneous while
    `combs' has been moved to the specfun package. To avoid transition
    problems, this new release is merely a dummy package with no functions,
    and dependent on the new version of the miscellaneous and specfun
    packages.

 ** The function `combs' (now part of the specfun package) has been
    deprecated in favour of `nchoosek' from Octave-core which should
    perform faster. The only difference is that it does accept string
    arrays (which does not make a lot of sense in the first place). To
    workaround this, the following can be used:
    
      char (nchoosek (double (n_string), k))

 ** Package is no longer automatically loaded.
