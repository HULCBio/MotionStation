Summary of important user-visible changes for fpl 1.3.3:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Fix for a bug in the ascii vtk unstructurd mesh exporter.

Summary of important user-visible changes for fpl 1.3.2:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 * raw/base64 vtk exporters have been rewritten in a more backward-compatible 
   way. This should also make fpl easier to install.

Summary of important user-visible changes for fpl 1.3.1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 * 1.3.1 is just a bugfix release to fix some issues in 1.3.0

Summary of important user-visible changes for fpl 1.3.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Old OpenDX based functions have been deprecated

 * ASCII VTK Unstructured Grid (VTU) exporter has been speeded up via
   code vectorization

 * A new function to write raw binary VTU files has been added.
   A new function to write base64-encoded binary VTU files has been added
   (requires Octave >= 3.7, will fall back to ASCII mode otherwise).
   As a rule of thumbs, ascii files are about 50% larger than base64 which
   are 30% larger than raw files. base64 files are faster to write (about 30% faster
   than raw on my machine for large meshes), ASCII files are more portable.

 * New functions to write ASCII structured grid VTK files have been added
