Warning: tk_octave is mostly unsupported.  Probably a better solution is to 
use extra/soctcl from octave-forge.  

If you decide to pursue tk_octave, please bear in mind that
the code is not safe as it is currently written.   Since octave's
reference counting classes do not use semaphores, there
is a small window in which a task switch could delete
an array in octave while tcl wanted to access it.
