Prerequisites
-------------
You will need GiNaC installed before you can install this package. Go to
the GiNaC web site http://www.ginac.de and follow the download 
instructions.  It will tell you how to get cln and also how to build 
GiNaC once you have built cln.  

You will also need a version of Octave that was compiled without the 
-fno-rtti or -fno-exceptions.  Versions below octave-2.1.33 have these 
options by default.  These options are typically loacated in the 
Makeconf file in the top level directory.  After configure and before 
compile you can remove these options if you want to use an older 
version of octave. 

Compiling
----------  
Make sure that the correct version of mkoctfile is in your path.  Then 
just type gmake(or whatever you call you version of GNU Make) in the 
top level directory.  

Installing
----------
Just type "gmake INSTALL_PATH=/your/path install" and it will install 
all the .oct files and .m files in /your/path.  Add /your/path to your 
octave path.  Once you have it installed you will need to type symbols 
at the octave command prompt each session to initialize the toolbox.  
Then you can use all of the commands in the toolbox.  Command completion
will not work on the commands until after yopu have used them once.
