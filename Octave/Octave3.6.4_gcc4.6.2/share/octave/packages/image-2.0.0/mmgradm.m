## Calculates the morphological gradient @var{grad} of a given image @var{A}.
##
## In the first form, the same structuring element @var{se} is used for dilation
## and erosion. In the second form, @var{se_dil} and @var{se_ero} are the
## corresponding structuring elements used for dilation and erosion
##
## The image @var{A} must be a grayscale or a binary image.
##
## The morphological gradient of a image corresponds to its erosion subtracted
## to its dilation.
