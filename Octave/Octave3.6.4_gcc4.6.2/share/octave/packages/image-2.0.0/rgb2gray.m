## @deftypefn {Function File} @var{gray}= rgb2gray (@var{rgb})
## Convert RGB image or colormap to grayscale.
##
## If @var{rgb} is an RGB image, the conversion to grayscale is weighted based
## on the luminance values (see @code{rgb2ntsc}).  Supported classes are single,
## double,  uint8 and uint16.
##
## If @var{rgb} is a colormap it is converted into the YIQ space of ntsc.  The
## luminance value (Y) is taken to create a gray colormap.
