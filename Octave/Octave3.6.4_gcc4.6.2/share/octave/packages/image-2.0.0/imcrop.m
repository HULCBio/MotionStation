## @deftypefn {Function File} @var{cropped} = imcrop (@var{Img})
## Crop image.
##
## Displays the image @var{Img} in a figure window and waits for user to select
## two points to define the bounding box.  First click on the top left and then
## on the bottom right corner of the region.  The function will not return until
## two valid points in the correct order are selected.
##
## Returns the @var{cropped} image.
