## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{B} =} imdilate (@var{A}, @var{se})
## Perform morphological dilation on a given image.
##
## The image @var{A} must be a grayscale or binary image, and @var{se} a
## structuring element. Both must have the same class, e.g., if @var{A} is a
## logical matrix, @var{se} must also be logical. Note that the erosion
## algorithm is different for each class, being much faster for logical
## matrices. As such, if you have a binary matrix, you should use @code{logical}
## first. This will also reduce the memory usage of your code.
##
## The center of @var{SE} is calculated using floor((size(@var{SE})+1)/2).
##
## Pixels outside the image are considered to be 0.
##
## @seealso{imerode, imopen, imclose}

  ## Perform filtering
  ## Filtering must be done with the reflection of the structuring element (they
  ## are not always symmetrical)

  ## If image is binary/logical, try to use filter2 (much faster)

%!demo
%! imdilate(eye(5),ones(2,2))
%! % returns a thick diagonal.

%!assert(imdilate(eye(3),[1]), eye(3));                     # using [1] as a mask returns the same value
%!assert(logical(imdilate(eye(3),[1])), logical(eye(3)));   # same with logical matrix
%!assert(imdilate(eye(3),[1,0,0]), [0,0,0;1,0,0;0,1,0]);                            # check if it works with non-symmetric SE
%!assert(imdilate(logical(eye(3)),logical([1,0,0])), logical([0,0,0;1,0,0;0,1,0])); # same with logical matrix
## test if center is correctly calculated on even masks. There's no right way,

## it all depends what is considered the center of the structuring element. The
## expected answer here is what Matlab does
%!xtest assert(imdilate(eye(5),[1,0,0,0]), [0,0,0,0,0;1,0,0,0,0;0,1,0,0,0;0,0,1,0,0;0,0,0,1,0]);
