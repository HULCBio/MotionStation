## Computes the local intensity range in a neighbourhood around each pixel in
## an image.
##
## The intensity range of the pixels of a neighbourhood is computed as
##
## @example
## @var{R} = max (@var{x}) - min (@var{x})
## @end example
##
## where @var{x} is the value of the pixels in the neighbourhood,
##
## The neighbourhood is defined by the @var{domain} binary mask. Elements of the
## mask with a non-zero value are considered part of the neighbourhood. By default
## a 3 by 3 matrix containing only non-zero values is used.
##
## At the border of the image, extrapolation is used. By default symmetric
## extrapolation is used, but any method supported by the @code{padarray} function
## can be used.
