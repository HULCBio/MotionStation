## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{BW} =} im2bw (@var{img}, threshold)
## @deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{BW} =} im2bw (@var{X}, @var{cmap}, threshold)
## Convert image to binary, black and white, by threshold.
##
## The input image @var{img} can either be a grayscale or RGB image.  In the later
## case, @var{img} is first converted to grayscale with @code{rgb2gray}.  Input
## can also be an indexed image @var{X} in which case the colormap @var{cmap}
## needs to be specified.
##
## The value of @var{threshold} should be in the range [0,1] independently of the
## class of @var{img}.  Values from other classes can be converted to the correct
## value with @code{im2double} for example.  For an automatic threshold, consider
## using @code{graythresh}.
##
## @example
## @group
## bw = im2bw (img, graythresh (img));
## @end group
## @end example
##
## @seealso{graythresh, ind2gray, rgb2gray}
## @end deftypefn
