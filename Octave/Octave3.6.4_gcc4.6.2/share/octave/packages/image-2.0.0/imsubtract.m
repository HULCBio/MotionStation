## @deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{out} =} imsubtract (@var{a}, @var{b}, @var{class})
## Subtract image or constant to an image.
##
## If @var{a} and @var{b} are two images of same size and class, @var{b} is subtracted
## to @var{a}. Alternatively, if @var{b} is a floating-point scalar, its value is subtracted
## to the image @var{a}.
##
## The class of @var{out} will be the same as @var{a} unless @var{a} is logical
## in which case @var{out} will be double. Alternatively, it can be
## specified with @var{class}.
##
## @emph{Note 1}: you can force output class to be logical by specifying
## @var{class}. This is incompatible with @sc{matlab} which will @emph{not} honour
## request to return a logical matrix.
##
## @emph{Note 2}: the values are truncated to the mininum value of the output
## class.
##
## @emph{NOte 3}: values are truncated before the operation so if input images are
## unsigned integers and the request output class is a signed integer, it may lead
## to unexpected results:
##
## @example
## @group
## imsubtract (uint8 ([23 190]), uint8 ([24 200]), "int8")
##      @result{} -1  0
## @end group
## @end example
##
## Because both 190 and 200 were truncated to 127 before subtraction, their difference
## is zero.
## @seealso{imabsdiff, imadd, imcomplement, imdivide, imlincomb, immultiply}
## @end deftypefn

    ## imsubtract (uint8(150), uint8 (200), "int8");

    ## There is no matlab compatibility issue because matlab does not have the option
    ## to specify output class in imsubtract
