## @deftypefnx{Function File} {@var{E} =} entropy (@var{im}, @var{nbins})
## Computes the entropy of an image.
##
## The entropy of the elements of the image @var{im} is computed as
##
## @example
## @var{E} = -sum (@var{P} .* log2 (@var{P})
## @end example
##
## where @var{P} is the distribution of the elements of @var{im}. The distribution
## is approximated using a histogram with @var{nbins} cells. If @var{im} is
## @code{logical} then two cells are used by default. For other classes 256 cells
## are used by default.
##
## When the entropy is computed, zero-valued cells of the histogram are ignored.
