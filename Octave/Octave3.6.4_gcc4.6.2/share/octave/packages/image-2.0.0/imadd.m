## Add image or constant to an image.
##
## If @var{a} and @var{b} are two images of same size and class, the images are
## added. Alternatively, if @var{b} is a floating-point scalar, its value is added
## to the image @var{a}.
##
## The class of @var{out} will be the same as @var{a} unless @var{a} is logical
## in which case @var{out} will be double. Alternatively, it can be
## specified with @var{class}.
##
## @emph{Note 1}: you can force output class to be logical by specifying
## @var{class}. This is incompatible with @sc{matlab} which will @emph{not} honour
## request to return a logical matrix.
##
## @emph{Note 2}: the values are truncated to the maximum value of the output
## class.

  ## output class is the same as input img, unless img is logical in which case
  ## it should be double. Tested in matlab by Freysh at ##matlab:
  ##   - if you imadd 2 logical matrix, it's not the union. You actually get values of 2
  ##   - the previous is true even if you specify "logical" as output class. It does
  ##     not honors the request, output will be double class anyway, not even a
  ##     warning will be issued (but we in octave are nicer and will)
  ##   - you can specify smaller integer types for output than input and values
  ##     are truncated. Input uint16 and request uint8, it will be respected

  ## this is matlab imcompatible on purpose. We are compatible and return double
  ## anyway, even if both input are logical (and wether this is correct is
  ## already debatable), but if the user forcelly requests output class to be
  ## logical, then he must be expecting it (matlab returns double anyway and
  ## ignores request).
