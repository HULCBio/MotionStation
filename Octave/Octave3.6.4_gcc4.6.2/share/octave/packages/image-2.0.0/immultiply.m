## Multiply image by another image or constant.
##
## If @var{a} and @var{b} are two images of same size and class, the images are
## multiplied. Alternatively, if @var{b} is a floating-point scalar, @var{a} is
## multiplie by it.
##
## The class of @var{out} will be the same as @var{a} unless @var{a} is logical
## in which case @var{out} will be double. Alternatively, it can be
## specified with @var{class}.
##
## @emph{Note}: the values are truncated to the mininum value of the output
## class.
