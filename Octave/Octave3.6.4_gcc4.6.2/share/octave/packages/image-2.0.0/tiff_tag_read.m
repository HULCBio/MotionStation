## Read value of @var{tag}s from TIFF files.
##
## @var{file} must be a TIFF file and @var{tag} should be a tag ID. To check
## multiple tags, @var{tag} can be a vector. If @var{ifd} is supplied, only
## those IFDs (Image File Directory) will be read. As with @var{tag}, multiple
## IFDs can be checked by using a vector or with the string `all'. By default,
## only the first IFD is read.
##
## @var{value} and @var{offset} will be a matrix with a number of rows and
## columns equal to the number of @var{tag}s and @var{ifd}s requested. The index
## relate to the same order as the input. @var{offset} has the same structure as
## @var{value} and when equal to 1 its matching value on @var{value} will be an
## offset to a position in the file.
##
## @var{tag}s that can't be found will have a value of 0 and the corresponding
## @var{offset} will be 2.
##
## If an error occurs when reading @var{file} (such as lack of permissions of file
## is not a TIFF file), @var{offset} is set to -1 and @var{value} contains the
## error message.
##
## See the following examples:
## @example
## @group
## ## read value of tag 258 on IFD 1 (`off' will be 1 if `val' is an offset or 2 if not found)
## [val, off] = tiff_tag_read (filepath, 258);
## @end group
## @end example
##
## @example
## @group
## ## read value 258, 262, 254 o IFD 1 (`val' and `off' will be a 1x3 matrix)
## [val, off] = tiff_tag_read (filepath, [258 262 254]);
## if (off(1) == -1), error ("something happpened: %s", val); endif
## off(2,1)   # will be 1 if val(2,1) is an offset to a file position or 2 if tag was not found
## val(2,1)   # value of tag 262 on IFD 1
## @end group
## @end example
##
## @example
## @group
## ## read value 258, 262, 254 on the first 10 IFDs 1 (`val' and `off' will be a 1x10 matrix)
## [val, off] = tiff_tag_read (filepath, [258 262 254], 1:10);

## Explanation of the TIFF file structure:
##
## The idea of multi-page images meeds to be understood first. These allow one file
## to have multiple images. This may sound strange but consider situtations such as
## an MRI scan (one file can then contain one scan which is multiple images across
## one of the axis) or time-lapse experiment (where one file is not unlike a movie).
## TIFF files support this by being like a container of single images, called IFD
## (Image File Directory). For each page there will be a single IFD. One can see a
## TIFF as an archive file of multiple images files that many times have a single file.
##
## Each TIFF file starts with a small header that identifies the file as TIFF. The
## header ends with the position on the file for the first IFD. Each IFD has multiple
## entries that hold information about the image of that IFD including where on the
## file is the actual image. Each IFD entry is identified by a tag. Each tag has a
## unique meaning; for example, the IFD entry with tag 259 will say the compression
## type (if any), of the image in that IFD.
##
## A TIFF file will always have at least one IFD and each IFD will always have at
## least one IFD entry.
##
## * On the TIFF image file header:
##     bytes 00-01 --> byte order used within the file: "II" for little endian
##                     and "MM" for big endian byte ordering.
##     bytes 02-03 --> number 42 that identifies the file as TIFF
##     bytes 04-07 --> file offset (in bytes) of the first IFD (Image File Directory)
##
##   Note: offset is always from the start of the file ("bof" in fread) and first
##   byte has an offset of zero.
##
## * On a TIFF's IFD structure:
##     bytes 00-01 --> number of entries (or tags or fields or directories)
##     bytes 02-13 --> the IFD entry #0
##     bytes 14+=11 -> the IFD entry #N. Each will have exactly 12 bytes (the
##                     number of IFD entries was specified at the start of the IFD)
##     bytes XX-XX --> file offset for next IFD (last 4 bytes of the IFD) or 0
##                     if it's the last IFD
##
## * On an IFD entry structure:
##     bytes 00-01 --> tag that identifies the entry
##     bytes 02-03 --> entry type
##                      1  --> BYTE (uint8)
##                      2  --> ASCII
##                      3  --> SHORT (uint16)
##                      4  --> LONG (uint32)
##                      5  --> RATIONAL (two LONGS)
##                      6  --> SBYTE (int8)
##                      7  --> UNDEFINED (8 bit)
##                      8  --> SSHORT (int16)
##                      9  --> SLONG (int32)
##                      10 --> FLOAT (single IEEE precision)
##                      11 --> DOUBLE (double IEEE precision)
##     bytes 04-07 --> number of values (count)
##     bytes 08-11 --> file offset (from the beggining of file) or value (only if
##                     it fits in 4 bytes). It is possible that the offset is for
##                     a structure and not a value so we return the offset
##
##   Note: file offset of the value may point anywhere in the file, even after the image.
##
## Tags numbered >= 32768 are private tags
## Tags numbered on the 65000--65535 range are reusable tags
