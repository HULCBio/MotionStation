## Computes the local standard deviation in a neighbourhood around each pixel in
## an image.
##
## The standard deviation of the pixels of a neighbourhood is computed as
##
## @example
## @var{S} = sqrt ((sum (@var{x} - @var{mu}).^2)/(@var{N}-1))
## @end example
##
## where @var{mu} is the mean value of the pixels in the neighbourhood,
## @var{N} is the number of pixels in the neighbourhood. So, an unbiased estimator
## is used.
##
## The neighbourhood is defined by the @var{domain} binary mask. Elements of the
## mask with a non-zero value are considered part of the neighbourhood. By default
## a 3 by 3 matrix containing only non-zero values is used.
##
## At the border of the image, extrapolation is used. By default symmetric
## extrapolation is used, but any method supported by the @code{padarray} function
## can be used. Since extrapolation is used, one can expect a lower deviation near
## the image border.
