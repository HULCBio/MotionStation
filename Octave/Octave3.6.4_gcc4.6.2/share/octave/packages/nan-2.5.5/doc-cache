 BLAND_ALTMANN shows the Bland-Altman plot of two columns of measurements
   and computes several summary results. 

   bland_altman(m1, m2 [,group])
   bland_altman(data [, group])
   R = bland_altman(...)
 
   m1,m2 are two colums with the same number of elements
	containing the measurements. m1,m2 can be also combined 
       in a single two column data matrix. 
   group [optional] indicates which measurements belong to the same group
	This is useful to account for repeated measurements.

 CAT2BIN converts categorial into binary data 
   each category of each column in D is converted into a logical column
 
   B = cat2bin(C); 
   [B,BinLabel] = cat2bin(C,Label); 
   [B,BinLabel] = cat2bin(C,Label,MODE)

  C        categorial data 
  B        binary data 
  Label    description of each column in C
  BinLabel description of each column in B
  MODE     default [], ignores NaN
           'notIgnoreNAN' includes binary column for NaN 
           'IgnoreZeros'  zeros do not get a separate category 
           'IgnoreZeros+NaN' zeros and NaN are ignored

  example: 
     cat2bin([1;2;5;1;5]) results in

 CLASSIFY classifies sample data into categories 
 defined by the training data and its group information 

  CLASS = classify(sample, training, group) 
  CLASS = classify(sample, training, group, TYPE) 
  [CLASS,ERR,POSTERIOR,LOGP,COEF] = CLASSIFY(...) 

  CLASS contains the assigned group. 
  ERR is the classification error on the training set weighted by the 
	prior propability of each group. 

  The same classifier as in TRAIN_SC are supported. 

 ATTENTION: no cross-validation is applied, therefore the 
    classification error is too optimistic (overfitting). 
    Use XVAL instead to obtain cross-validated performance.

 CORRCOEF calculates the correlation matrix from pairwise correlations.
   The input data can contain missing values encoded with NaN.
   Missing data (NaN's) are handled by pairwise deletion [15]. 
   In order to avoid possible pitfalls, use case-wise deletion or 
   or check the correlation of NaN's with your data (see below). 
   A significance test for testing the Hypothesis  
   'correlation coefficient R is significantly different to zero' 
   is included. 

 [...] = CORRCOEF(X);
      calculates the (auto-)correlation matrix of X
 [...] = CORRCOEF(X,Y);
      calculates the crosscorrelation between X and Y

 [...] = CORRCOEF(..., Mode);
       Mode='Pearson' or 'parametric' [default]
               gives the correlation coefficient  
               also known as the 'product-moment coefficient of correlation' 
               or 'Pearson''s correlation' [1]
       Mode='Spearman' 	gives 'Spearman''s Rank Correlation Coefficient'
               This replaces SPEARMAN.M
       Mode='Rank' 		gives a nonparametric Rank Correlation Coefficient
               This is the "Spearman rank correlation with proper handling of ties"
               This replaces RANKCORR.M

 [...] = CORRCOEF(..., param1, value1, param2, value2, ... );
	param 		value
	'Mode'		type of correlation 
		'Pearson','parametric'
		'Spearman'
		'rank'
	'rows'		how do deal with missing values encoded as NaN's. 	
		'complete': remove all rows with at least one NaN
		'pairwise': [default]
	'alpha'		0.01	: significance level to compute confidence interval

 [R,p,ci1,ci2,nansig] = CORRCOEF(...);
 	R is the correlation matrix
	R(i,j) is the correlation coefficient r between X(:,i) and Y(:,j)
  p    gives the significance of R
	It tests the null hypothesis that the product moment correlation coefficient is zero 
       using Student's t-test on the statistic t = r*sqrt(N-2)/sqrt(1-r^2) 
       where N is the number of samples (Statistics, M. Spiegel, Schaum series).
  p > alpha: do not reject the Null hypothesis: 'R is zero'.
  p < alpha: The alternative hypothesis 'R is larger than zero' is true with probability (1-alpha).
  ci1	lower (1-alpha) confidence interval 
  ci2	upper (1-alpha) confidence interval
	If no alpha is provided, the default alpha is 0.01. This can be changed with function flag_implicit_significance. 
  nan_sig 	p-value whether H0: 'NaN''s are not correlated' could be correct
       if nan_sig < alpha, H1 ('NaNs are correlated') is very likely. 
 
 The result is only valid if the occurence of NaN's is uncorrelated. In
 order to avoid this pitfall, the correlation of NaN's should be checked 
 or case-wise deletion should be applied. 
   Case-Wise deletion can be implemented 
    ix = ~any(isnan([X,Y]),2);
    [...] = CORRCOEF(X(ix,:),Y(ix,:),...); 

  Correlation (non-random distribution) of NaN's can be checked with 
       [nan_R,nan_sig]=corrcoef(X,isnan(X))
   or  [nan_R,nan_sig]=corrcoef([X,Y],isnan([X,Y]))
   or  [R,p,ci1,ci2] = CORRCOEF(...);

 Further recommandation related to the correlation coefficient: 
 + LOOK AT THE SCATTERPLOTS to make sure that the relationship is linear
 + Correlation is not causation because 
	it is not clear which parameter is 'cause' and which is 'effect' and
       the observed correlation between two variables might be due to the action of other, unobserved variables.

 COV covariance matrix
 X and Y can contain missing values encoded with NaN.
 NaN's are skipped, NaN do not result in a NaN output. 
 The output gives NaN only if there are insufficient input data
 The mean is removed from the data. 
 
 Remark: for data contains missing values, the resulting 
 matrix might not be positiv definite, and its elements have magnitudes
 larger than one. This ill-behavior is more likely for small sample 
 sizes, but there is no garantee that the result "behaves well" for larger
 sample sizes. If you want the a "well behaved" result (i.e. positive 
 definiteness and magnitude of elements not larger than 1), use CORRCOEF. 
 However, COV is faster than CORRCOEF and might be good enough in some cases.

 C = COV(X [,Mode]);
      calculates the (auto-)correlation matrix of X
 C = COV(X,Y [,Mode]);
      calculates the crosscorrelation between X and Y. 
      C(i,j) is the correlation between the i-th and jth 
      column of X and Y, respectively. 
   NOTE: Octave and Matlab have (in some special cases) incompatible implemenations. 
       This implementation follows Octave. If the result could be ambigous or  
       incompatible, a warning will be presented in Matlab. To avoid this warning use: 
       a) use COV([X(:),Y(:)]) if you want the traditional Matlab result. 
       b) use C = COV([X,Y]), C = C(1:size(X,2),size(X,2)+1:size(C,2)); if you want to be compatible with this software.  

 Mode = 0 [default] scales C by (N-1)
 Mode = 1 scales C by N.

 C = covm(...); 
 	C is the scaled by N in Mode M and by (N-1) in mode D.
 [C,N] = covm(...);
	C is not scaled, provides the scaling factor N  
	C./N gives the scaled version.

 FLAG_ACCURACY_LEVEL sets and gets accuracy level 
   used in SUMSKIPNAN_MEX and COVM_MEX
   The error margin of the naive summation is N*eps (N is the number of samples),
   the error margin is only 2*eps if Kahan's summation is used [1].    

	0: maximum speed [default]
	   accuracy of double (64bit) with naive summation (error = N*2^-52) 
	1: accuracy of extended (80bit) with naive summation (error = N*2^-64) 
	2: accuracy of double (64bit) with Kahan summation (error = 2^-52) 
	3: accuracy of extended (80bit) with Kahan summation  (error = 2^-64)  

   Please note, level 3 might be equally accurate but slower than 1 or 2 on
   some platforms. In order to determine what is good for you, you might want
   to run ACCTEST. 

 FLAG = flag_accuracy_level()

 The use of FLAG_IMPLICIT_SIGNIFICANCE is in experimental state. 
 flag_implicit_significance might even become obsolete.

 FLAG_IMPLICIT_SIGNIFICANCE sets and gets default alpha (level) of any significance test
 The default alpha-level is stored in the global variable FLAG_implicit_significance
 The idea is that the significance must not be assigned explicitely. 
 This might yield more readable code. 

 Choose alpha low enough, because in alpha*100% of the cases, you will 
 reject the Null hypothesis just by change. For this reason, the default
 alpha is 0.01. 
 
   flag_implicit_significance(0.01) 
	sets the alpha-level for the significance test
 
 alpha = flag_implicit_significance()
 	gets default alpha

 flag_implicit_significance(alpha)
 	sets default alpha-level

 alpha = flag_implicit_significance(alpha)
	gets and sets alpha 

 features:
 - compatible to Matlab and Octave

 FLAG_IMPLICIT_SKIP_NAN sets and gets default mode for handling NaNs
	1 skips NaN's (the default mode if no mode is set)
 	0 NaNs are propagated; input NaN's give NaN's at the output
 
 FLAG = flag_implicit_skip_nan()
 	gets current mode

 flag_implicit_skip_nan(FLAG)
 sets mode 

 prevFLAG = flag_implicit_skip_nan(nextFLAG)
	gets previous set FLAG and sets FLAG for the future
 flag_implicit_skip_nan(prevFLAG)
	resets FLAG to previous mode

 It is used in: 
	SUMSKIPNAN, MEDIAN, QUANTILES, TRIMEAN
 and affects many other functions like: 
	CENTER, KURTOSIS, MAD, MEAN, MOMENT, RMS, SEM, SKEWNESS, 
	STATISTIC, STD, VAR, ZSCORE etc. 

 The mode is stored in the global variable FLAG_implicit_skip_nan
 It is recommended to use flag_implicit_skip_nan(1) as default and
 flag_implicit_skip_nan(0) should be used for exceptional cases only.
 This feature might disappear without further notice, so you should really not
 rely on it.

 FLAG_NANS_OCCURED checks whether the last call(s) to sumskipnan or covm 
 contained any not-a-numbers in the input argument. Because many other 
 functions like mean, std, etc. are also using sumskipnan, 
 also these functions can be checked for NaN's in the input data. 
 
 A call to FLAG_NANS_OCCURED() resets also the flag whether NaN's occured. 
 Only sumskipnan or covm can set the flag again.

 FSS - feature subset selection and feature ranking 
   the method is motivated by the max-relevance-min-redundancy (mRMR) 
   approach [1]. However, the default method uses partial correlation,
   which has been developed from scratch. PCCM [3] describes
   a similar idea, but is more complicated. 
   An alternative method based on FSDD is implemented, too. 
    
  [idx,score] = fss(D,cl) 
  [idx,score] = fss(D,cl,MODE) 
  [idx,score] = fss(D,cl,MODE) 
    
 D 	data - each column represents a feature 
 cl	classlabel   
 Mode 	'Pearson' [default] correlation
	'rank' correlation 
       'FSDD' feature selection algorithm based on a distance discriminant [2]
       %%% 'MRMR','MID','MIQ' max-relevance, min redundancy [1] - not supported yet.

 PARTCORRCOEF calculates the partial correlation between X and Y
 after removing the influence of Z.
 X, Y and Z can contain missing values encoded with NaN.
 NaN's are skipped, NaN do not result in a NaN output. 
 (Its assumed that the occurence of NaN's is uncorrelated) 
 The output gives NaN, only if there are insufficient input data.

  The partial correlation  is defined as 
  pcc(xy|z)=(cc(x,y)-cc(x,z)*cc(y,z))/sqrt((1-cc(x,y)ï¿½)*((1-cc(x,z)ï¿½)))


 PARTCORRCOEF(X [,Mode]);
      calculates the (auto-)correlation matrix of X
 PARTCORRCOEF(X,Y,Z);
 PARTCORRCOEF(X,Y,Z,[]);
 PARTCORRCOEF(X,Y,Z,'Pearson');
 PARTCORRCOEF(X,Y,Z,'Rank');
 PARTCORRCOEF(X,Y,Z,'Spearman');

 Mode=[] [default]
	removes from X and Y the part that can be explained by Z
	and computes the correlation of the remaining part. 
 	Ideally, this is equivalent to Mode='Pearson', however, in practice
	this is more accurate.
 Mode='Pearson' or 'parametric'
 Mode='Spearman'
 Mode='Rank'
	computes the partial correlation based on cc(x,y),cc(x,z) and cc(y,z) 
	with the respective mode. 

 [R,p,ci1,ci2] = PARTCORRCOEF(...);
  r is the partialcorrelation matrix
	r(i,j) is the partial correlation coefficient r between X(:,i) and Y(:,j) 
	when influence of Z is removed. 
  p    gives the significance of PCC
	It tests the null hypothesis that the product moment correlation coefficient is zero 
       using Student's t-test on the statistic t = r sqrt(N-Nz-2)/sqrt(1-r^2) 
       where N is the number of samples (Statistics, M. Spiegel, Schaum series).
  p > alpha: do not reject the Null hypothesis: "R is zero".
  p < alpha: The alternative hypothesis "R2 is larger than zero" is true with probability (1-alpha).
  ci1	lower 0.95 confidence interval 
  ci2	upper 0.95 confidence interval

 The rank correlation   r = corrcoef(ranks(x)). 
 is often confused with Spearman's rank correlation.  
 Spearman's correlation is defined as 
   r(x,y) = 1-6*sum((ranks(x)-ranks(y)).^2)/(N*(N*N-1))
 The results are different. Here, the former version is implemented.

 various statistics (e.g. MEAN, STD, VAR, RMS, MEANSQ, SKEWNESS, 
 KURTOSIS, MOMENT, STATISTIC etc.) from data with missing values.  
 SUMSKIPNAN implements the DIMENSION-argument for data with missing values.
 Also the second output argument return the number of valid elements (not NaNs)

 Train a (statistical) classifier
 
  CC = train_sc(D,classlabel)
  CC = train_sc(D,classlabel,MODE)
  CC = train_sc(D,classlabel,MODE, W)
	weighting D(k,:) with weight W(k) (not all classifiers supported weighting)

 CC contains the model parameters of a classifier which can be applied 
   to test data using test_sc. 
   R = test_sc(CC,D,...) 

   D		training samples (each row is a sample, each column is a feature)	
   classlabel	labels of each sample, must have the same number of rows as D. 
 		Two different encodings are supported: 
		{-1,1}-encoding (multiple classes with separate columns for each class) or
		1..M encoding. 
 		So [1;2;3;1;4] is equivalent to 
			[+1,-1,-1,-1;
			[-1,+1,-1,-1;
			[-1,-1,+1,-1;
			[+1,-1,-1,-1]
			[-1,-1,-1,+1]
		Note, samples with classlabel=0 are ignored.

 CC contains the model parameters of a classifier. Some time ago,     
 CC was a statistical classifier containing the mean 
 and the covariance of the data of each class (encoded in the 
  so-called "extended covariance matrices". Nowadays, also other 
 classifiers are supported.

 TRIMMEAN calculates the trimmed mean by removing the fraction of p/2 upper and 
 p/2 lower samples. Missing values (encoded as NaN) are ignored and not taken into account. 
 The same number from the upper and lower values are removed, and is compatible to various
 spreadsheet programs including GNumeric [1], LibreOffice, OpenOffice and MS Excel.

  Q = trimmean(Y,p)
  Q = trimmean(Y,p,DIM)
     returns the TRIMMEAN along dimension DIM of sample array Y.
  If p is a vector, the TRIMMEAN for each p is computed.

 TTEST (paired) t-test
     For a sample X from a normal distribution with unknown mean and
     variance, perform a t-test of the null hypothesis `mean (X) == M'.
     Under the null, the test statistic T follows a Student
     distribution with `DF = length (X) - 1' degrees of freedom.

     TTEST treads NaNs as "Missing values" and ignores these. 

 H = ttest(x,m)
	tests Null-hypothesis that mean of x is m.

 H = ttest(x,y,alpha,tail)
 H = ttest(x,y,alpha,tail,DIM)

     level of alpha (default alpha = 0.05).	 
 
     With the optional argument string TAIL, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If TAIL is '!=' or '<>' or 'both', the null is tested
     against the two-sided Alternative `mean (X) ~= mean (Y)'.  If TAIL
     is '>' or 'right', the one-sided Alternative `mean (X) > mean (Y)' is used.
     Similarly for '<' or 'left', the one-sided Alternative `mean (X) < mean
     (Y)' is used.  The default is the two-sided case.
 
     H returns whether the Null-Hypotheses must be rejected. 
     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL. 
 
     TTEST works on the first non-singleton dimension or on DIM. 

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is
     displayed.

 XCOVF generates cross-covariance function. 
 XCOVF is the same as XCORR except 
   X and Y can contain missing values encoded with NaN.
   NaN's are skipped, NaN do not result in a NaN output. 
   The output gives NaN only if there are insufficient input data

 [C,N,LAGS] = xcovf(X,MAXLAG,SCALEOPT);
      calculates the (auto-)correlation function of X
 [C,N,LAGS] = xcovf(X,Y,MAXLAG,SCALEOPT);
      calculates the crosscorrelation function between X and Y

  SCALEOPT   [character string] specifies the type of scaling applied
          to the correlation vector (or matrix). is one of:
    'none'      return the unscaled correlation, R,
    'biased'    return the biased average, R/N, 
    'unbiased'  return the unbiassed average, R(k)/(N-|k|), 
    'coeff'     return the correlation coefficient, R/(rms(x).rms(y)),
          where "k" is the lag, and "N" is the length of X.
          If omitted, the default value is "none".
          If Y is supplied but does not have the ame length as X,
          scale must be "none".

    classlabel	labels of each sample, must have the same number of rows as D. 
 		Two different encodings are supported: 
		{-1,1}-encoding (multiple classes with separate columns for each class) or
		1..M encoding. 
 		So [1;2;3;1;4] is equivalent to 
			[+1,-1,-1,-1;
			[-1,+1,-1,-1;
			[-1,-1,+1,-1;
			[+1,-1,-1,-1]
			[-1,-1,-1,+1]
		Note, samples with classlabel=0 are ignored. 

    CLASSIFIER can be any classifier supported by train_sc (default='LDA')
       {'REG','MDA','MD2','QDA','QDA2','LD2','LD3','LD4','LD5','LD6','NBC','aNBC','WienerHopf', 'RDA','GDBC',
	 'SVM','RBF','PSVM','SVM11','SVM:LIN4','SVM:LIN0','SVM:LIN1','SVM:LIN2','SVM:LIN3','WINNOW'}
       these can be modified by ###/GSVD, ###/sparse and ###/DELETION. 
	   /DELETION removes in case of NaN's either the rows or the columns (which removes less data values) with any NaN
	   /sparse and /GSVD preprocess the data an reduce it to some lower-dimensional space. 
       Hyperparameters (like alpha for PLA, gamma/lambda for RDA, c_value for SVM, etc) can be defined as 
 	CLASSIFIER.hyperparameter.alpha, etc. and 
 	CLASSIFIER.TYPE = 'PLA' (as listed above). 
       See train_sc for details.
    W:	weights for each sample (row) in D. 
	default: [] (i.e. all weights are 1)
	number of elements in W must match the number of rows of D 
    NG: used to define the type of cross-valdiation
 	Leave-One-Out-Method (LOOM): NG = [1:length(classlabel)]' (default)
 	Leave-K-Out-Method: NG = ceil([1:length(classlabel)]'/K)
	K-fold XV:  NG = ceil([1:length(classlabel)]'*K/length(classlabel))
	group-wise XV (if samples are not indepentent) can be also defined here
	samples from the same group (dependent samples) get the same identifier
	samples from different groups get different classifiers
    TYPE:  defines the type of cross-validation procedure if NG is not specified 
	'LOOM'  leave-one-out-method
       k	k-fold crossvalidation

 OUTPUT: 
    R contains the resulting performance metric
    CC contains the classifier  

    plota(R) shows the confusion matrix of the results

 zScoreMedian removes the median and standardizes by the 1.483*median absolute deviation

 Usage:  Z = zScoreMedian(X, DIM)
 Input:  X  : data
         DIM: dimension along which z-score should be calculated (1=columns, 2=rows) 
              (optional, default=first dimension with more than 1 element
 Output: Z  : z-scores

 ZSCORE removes the mean and normalizes the data 
 to a variance of 1. Can be used for Pre-Whitening of the data, too. 

 [z,r,m] = zscore(x,DIM)
   z   z-score of x along dimension DIM
   r   is the inverse of the standard deviation
   m   is the mean of x

 The data x can be reconstrated with 
     x = z*diag(1./r) + repmat(m,size(z)./size(m))  
     z = x*diag(r) - repmat(m.*v,size(z)./size(m))  

 DIM	dimension
	1: STATS of columns
	2: STATS of rows
	default or []: first DIMENSION, with more than 1 element
