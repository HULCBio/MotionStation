function [i,v,m] = zscore(i,DIM)
% ZSCORE removes the mean and normalizes the data 
% to a variance of 1. Can be used for Pre-Whitening of the data, too. 
%
% [z,r,m] = zscore(x,DIM)
%   z   z-score of x along dimension DIM
%   r   is the inverse of the standard deviation
%   m   is the mean of x
%
% The data x can be reconstrated with 
%     x = z*diag(1./r) + repmat(m,size(z)./size(m))  
%     z = x*diag(r) - repmat(m.*v,size(z)./size(m))  
%
% DIM	dimension
%	1: STATS of columns
%	2: STATS of rows
%	default or []: first DIMENSION, with more than 1 element
