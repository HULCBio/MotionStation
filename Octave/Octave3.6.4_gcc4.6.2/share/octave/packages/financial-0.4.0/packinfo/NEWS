 ** The function `datesplit' (just imported from the time package) has
    been deprecated in favour of `datevec' from Octave-core.

  ** The functions `rate' and `irr' should now be compatible with new
      releases of octave.

 ** The function `fetch' should now work properly when using google
    finnance to adapt to the UTF-8 file received.

 ** The function `dateaxis' should no longer enter in debug mode at the
    end of its call.

 ** The package is now dependent on the io package (version 1.0.18 or
    later) since the functions that it depended of from miscellaneous
    package have been moved to io.

 ** Package is no longer automatically loaded.
