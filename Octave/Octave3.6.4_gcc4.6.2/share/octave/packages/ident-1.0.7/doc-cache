     Plot inputs and ouputs defined by the system Z. Other inputs are
     optional.

     Simulate the effects of the MISO system defined by TH.  E is the
     noise in the input.  It is scaled by sqrt(v), where V is the noise
     variance given when you created the model, so for proper effect, E
     should have mean 0 and variance 1.

     If E is not given, then a noise free simulation is run.

     Create a theta structure from the IIR system `Ay = Bx'.  See
     poly2th for details on the theta structure.

     Represent the generalized Multi-Input, Single-Output (MISO) system
     defined as follows:

     A_j(q)y(t) = \sum_i=1^bn \left( \fracB_i(q)F_i(q) u_i(t) \right) +
     \fracC(q)D(q)e_j(t) where e is white noise u is the input signal y
     is the output signal

     V is the variance on the noise (default is 1) T is the sampling
     interval (default is 1)
