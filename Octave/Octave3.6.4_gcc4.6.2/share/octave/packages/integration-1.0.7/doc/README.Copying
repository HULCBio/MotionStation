Hi Octavers:

  I just checked with the author of the original MATLAB toolbox for
gaussian quadrature about using the toolbox with OCTAVE. And its
fine with him if we use/distribute the code for OCTAVE. So the ftp site
maintainers can put the integration toolbox port of mine for
distribution. Here's the message from Bryce Gradner on his permission.

Hi,

Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  I am on the octave mailing
list, so I already saw that you were porting the integration routines to
OCTAVE.  I am glad to see that you did; it is certainly OK with me to 
distribute them with OCTAVE.  I'm glad to see that they are being used.

Bryce
