 Numerical Integration Toolbox

 MATLAB Toolbox for 1-D, 2-D, and n-D Numerical Integration

 The original 1-D routines were obtained from NETLIB and were 
 written by
          Howard Wilson

          University of Alabama

 The rest of the routines were written by
          Bryce Gardner

 These are the general purpose integration routines: 

        quadg.m      -- High accuracy replacement for QUAD and QUAD8 (1-D)
        quad2dg.m    -- 2-D integration over a rectangular region
        quad2dggen.m -- 2-D integration over a general region
        quadndg.m    -- n-D integration over a n-D hyper-rectangular region

 Use the other routines if you want a specific integration quadrature or
 specific order of integration quadrature.  It is faster if you know that
 you need a 10th order integration quadrature to use it directly.  If you
 use the above routines, the integration will be done with quadratures of 
 several different orders until the results converge.
