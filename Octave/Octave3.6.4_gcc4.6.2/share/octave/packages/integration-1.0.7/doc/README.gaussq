%
% GAUSSQ  - Routines for Composite Gauss Integration
%
% The following routines perform numerical integration by
% composite Gauss integration. A function to give  base
% points and weight factors is also included. A document
% comparing results from these formulas and output from the
% function quad provided in MATLAB is provided to illustrate
% the accuracy obtainable using Gauss composite integration.
