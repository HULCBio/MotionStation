*********

If you encounter any bugs in the octave control package, please
DONT bother the great people behind SLICOT.  Most likely it's a
problem of the control package, not the proven SLICOT library.
Therefore, please send any reports to the octave mailing list
and the maintainer of the control package.
See the file packinfo/DESCRIPTION for the current maintainer
of the control package and his mail address.

SLICOT Readme
*************

SLICOT - Subroutine Library In COntrol Theory - is a general purpose basic
mathematical library for control theoretical computations.  The library
provides tools to perform essential system analysis and synthesis tasks.
The main emphasis in SLICOT is on numerical reliability of implemented
algorithms and the numerical robustness and efficiency of routines.
Providing algorithmic flexibility and the use of rigorous implementation
and documentation standards are other SLICOT features.

The SLICOT Library is available as standard Fortran 77 code in double
precision.  Each user-callable subroutine for control computations is
accompanied by an example program which illustrates the use of the
subroutine and can act as a template for the user's own routines.

The SLICOT Library is organized by chapters, sections and subsections.
The following chapters are currently included:

A : Analysis Routines
B : Benchmark and Test Problems
D : Data Analysis
F : Filtering
I : Identification
M : Mathematical Routines
N : Nonlinear Systems
    (not yet available, except for some auxiliary routines for Wiener systems)
S : Synthesis Routines
T : Transformation Routines
U : Utility Routines

The SLICOT Library is built on LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) and BLAS
(Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) collections.  Therefore, these
packages should be available on the platform used.
