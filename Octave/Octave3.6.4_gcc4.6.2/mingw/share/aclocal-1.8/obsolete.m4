# We put here only the macros whose substitution is not an Automake
# macro; otherwise including this file would trigger dependencies for
# all the substitutions.  Generally, obsolete Automake macros are
# better AU_DEFUNed in the same file as their replacement, or alone in
# a separate file (see obsol-gt.m4 or obsol-lt.m4 for instance).
