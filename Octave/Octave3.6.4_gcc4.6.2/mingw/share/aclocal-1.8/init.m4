# AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(PACKAGE, VERSION, [NO-DEFINE])
# AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([OPTIONS])
# -----------------------------------------------
# The call with PACKAGE and VERSION arguments is the old style
# call (pre autoconf-2.50), which is being phased out.  PACKAGE
# and VERSION should now be passed to AC_INIT and removed from
# the call to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.
# We support both call styles for the transition.  After
# the next Automake release, Autoconf can make the AC_INIT
# arguments mandatory, and then we can depend on a new Autoconf
# release and drop the old call support.
