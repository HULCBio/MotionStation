## Why `clean' and not somewhere else?  Not `mostlyclean' because
## people usually don't want to recompile this file.  And not
## `distclean' because of our informal rule: if `make' built it, then
## `clean' should delete it; if `configure' built it, then `distclean'
## should remove it (and if the maintainer built it, then
## maintainer-clean should remove it).
