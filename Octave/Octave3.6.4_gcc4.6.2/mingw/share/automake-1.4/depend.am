## This fragment is probably only useful for maintainers.  It relies
## on GNU make and gcc.  It is only included in the generated
## Makefile.in if `automake' is not passed the `--include-deps' flag.

## We must create the .deps directory if it doesn't exist.  We do it
## in this strange way to make sure the .deps directory exists,
## without trying to run mkdir for each compilation.
