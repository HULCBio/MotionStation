## The GNU Standards mandates that tags files be removed by
## maintainer-clean.  But I'm told (by François Pinard) that this is
## really because RMS usually includes TAGS files in his
## distributions.  Since we do not, we instead have "distclean" remove
## them.  The rule is: if the user built it, "distclean" removes it.
## If it is shipped, "maintainer-clean" removes it.
