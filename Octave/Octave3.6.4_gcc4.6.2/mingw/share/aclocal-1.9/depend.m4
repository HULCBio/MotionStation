# There are a few dirty hacks below to avoid letting `AC_PROG_CC' be
# written in clear, in which case automake, when reading aclocal.m4,
# will think it sees a *use*, and therefore will trigger all it's
# C support machinery.  Also note that it means that autoscan, seeing
# CC etc. in the Makefile, will ask for an AC_PROG_CC use...


# _AM_DEPENDENCIES(NAME)
# ----------------------
# See how the compiler implements dependency checking.
# NAME is "CC", "CXX", "GCJ", or "OBJC".
# We try a few techniques and use that to set a single cache variable.
#
# We don't AC_REQUIRE the corresponding AC_PROG_CC since the latter was
# modified to invoke _AM_DEPENDENCIES(CC); we would have a circular
# dependency, and given that the user is not expected to run this macro,
# just rely on AC_PROG_CC.
