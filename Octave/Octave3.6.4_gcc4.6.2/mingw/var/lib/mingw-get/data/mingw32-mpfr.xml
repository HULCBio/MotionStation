        <paragraph>
          The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
          computations with correct rounding. The main goal of MPFR is to
          provide a library for multiple-precision floating-point computation
          which is both efficient and has a well-defined semantics. It copies
          the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision
          floating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa). MPFR is based on the GMP
          multiple-precision library.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          The mingw32-mpfr package provides the documentation for the mpfr
          library, as well as the related development files.  The associated
          mingw32-libmpfr package provides the runtime library.
