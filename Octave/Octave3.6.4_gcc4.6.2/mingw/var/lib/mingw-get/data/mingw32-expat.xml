      <description lang="en" title="expat: XML parsing library written in C">
        <paragraph>expat is a C library for parsing XML written by James
          Clark. Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser.  This means that
          you register handlers with the parser before starting the parse.
          These handlers are called when the parser discovers the
          associated structures in the document being parsed.  A start tag
          is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
          register handlers.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The mingw32-expat package provides the xmlwf validation
          tool and documentation related to the library. The associated
          mingw32-libexpat package provides the runtime library and related
          development files.
