      <description lang="en" title="make: GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs" >
        <paragraph>The `make' utility automatically determines which pieces
          of a large program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to
          recompile them. GNU `make' was implemented by Richard Stallman
          and Roland McGrath.  Development since Version 3.76 has been
          handled by Paul D. Smith.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The MinGW/MSYS project provides two versions of make:
          the msys-make version acts generally more as make is intended
          to operate, and gives fewer headaches during execution. However,
          msys-make requires the MSYS dll.  This version, mingw32-make,
          does not require the MSYS dll, but because of the lack of POSIX
          support in "pure" Win32 has a number of known shortcomings in
          comparison.
