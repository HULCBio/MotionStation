Octave works best with gnuplot 4.4 or higher, which is available from
http://www.gnuplot.info.

In versions prior to 4.2.6 it is not possible to use the mouse to zoom in
on plots.  This is a limitation of earlier versions of gnuplot, which are
unable to zoom when the data it plots is not stored in a file.
