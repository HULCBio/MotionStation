<p>The function <code>daspk</code> can be used to solve DAEs of the form

<pre class="example">     0 = f (x-dot, x, t),    x(t=0) = x_0, x-dot(t=0) = x-dot_0
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where
x-dot
is the derivative of x.  The equation is solved using Petzold's
DAE solver <span class="sc">daspk</span>.

     <pre class="example">          x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0
</pre>
        <p>The solution is returned in the matrices <var>x</var> and <var>xdot</var>,
with each row in the result matrices corresponding to one of the
elements in the vector <var>t</var>.  The first element of <var>t</var>
should be t_0 and correspond to the initial state of the
system <var>x_0</var> and its derivative <var>xdot_0</var>, so that the first
row of the output <var>x</var> is <var>x_0</var> and the first row
of the output <var>xdot</var> is <var>xdot_0</var>.

        <p>The first argument, <var>fcn</var>, is a string, inline, or function handle
that names the function f to call to compute the vector of
residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

     <pre class="example">          <var>res</var> = f (<var>x</var>, <var>xdot</var>, <var>t</var>)
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">in which <var>x</var>, <var>xdot</var>, and <var>res</var> are vectors, and <var>t</var> is a
scalar.

        <p>If <var>fcn</var> is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array
of strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element names
the function f described above, and the second element names a
function to compute the modified Jacobian

</pre>
        <p>The second and third arguments to <code>daspk</code> specify the initial
condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument
specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired,
including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

        <p>The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to
be consistent.  If they are not consistent, you must use the
<code>daspk_options</code> function to provide additional information so
that <code>daspk</code> can compute a consistent starting point.

        <p>The fifth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of
times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for
avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a
discontinuity in the derivative.

        <p>After a successful computation, the value of <var>istate</var> will be
greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of <span class="sc">daspk</span>).

        <p>If the computation is not successful, the value of <var>istate</var> will be
less than zero and <var>msg</var> will contain additional information.

        <p>You can use the function <code>daspk_options</code> to set optional
parameters for <code>daspk</code>.

initial guesses for the unknown components must also be provided as

the second (the default is 0, so you must provide a set of
initial conditions that are consistent).

          <p>If this option is set to a nonzero value, you must also set the
<code>"algebraic variables"</code> option to declare which variables in the
problem are algebraic.

          <br><dt><code>"use initial condition heuristics"</code><dd>Set to a nonzero value to use the initial condition heuristics options
described below.

          <br><dt><code>"initial condition heuristics"</code><dd>A vector of the following parameters that can be used to control the
initial condition calculation.

               <p>Note that the maximum total number of Newton iterations allowed is
<code>MXNIT*MXNJ*MXNH</code> if the <code>"compute consistent initial

set to 2.

               <br><dt><code>LSOFF</code><dd>Set to a nonzero value to disable the linesearch algorithm (default is
0).

               <br><dt><code>EPINIT</code><dd>Swing factor in the Newton iteration convergence test.  The test is
applied to the residual vector, premultiplied by the approximate
Jacobian.  For convergence, the weighted RMS norm of this vector
(scaled by the error weights) must be less than <code>EPINIT*EPCON</code>,
where <code>EPCON</code> = 0.33 is the analogous test constant used in the
time steps.  The default is <code>EPINIT</code> = 0.01. 
</dl>

about the initial condition calculation (default is 0).

test.  You must also set the <code>"algebraic variables"</code> option to
declare which variables in the problem are algebraic (default is 0).

          <br><dt><code>"algebraic variables"</code><dd>A vector of the same length as the state vector.  A nonzero element
indicates that the corresponding element of the state vector is an
algebraic variable (i.e., its derivative does not appear explicitly
in the equation set.

<code>compute consistent initial condition"</code> and
<code>"exclude algebraic variables from error test"</code> options.

constraints specified by the <code>"inequality constraint types"</code>
option (default is 0).

               <ol type=1 start=1>

          <br><dt><code>"inequality constraint types"</code><dd>A vector of the same length as the state specifying the type of
inequality constraint.  Each element of the vector corresponds to an
element of the state and should be assigned one of the following
codes

<dt>-2<dd>Less than zero.

          <br><dt><code>"initial step size"</code><dd>Differential-algebraic problems may occasionally suffer from severe
scaling difficulties on the first step.  If you know a great deal
about the scaling of your problem, you can help to alleviate this
problem by specifying an initial stepsize (default is computed
automatically).

          <br><dt><code>"maximum order"</code><dd>Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  This option must
be between 1 and 5, inclusive (default is 5).

          <br><dt><code>"maximum step size"</code><dd>Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very large
regions (default is not specified).

        <p>Note that because of numerical errors in the constraint functions
due to round-off and integration error, <span class="sc">dasrt</span> may return false
roots, or return the same root at two or more nearly equal values of
<var>T</var>.  If such false roots are suspected, the user should consider
smaller error tolerances or higher precision in the evaluation of the
constraint functions.

        <p>If a root of some constraint function defines the end of the problem,
the input to <span class="sc">dasrt</span> should nevertheless allow integration to a
point slightly past that root, so that <span class="sc">dasrt</span> can locate the root
by interpolation.

        <p>The third and fourth arguments to <code>dasrt</code> specify the initial
condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument
specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired,
including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

        <p>The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to
be consistent.  In practice, however, <span class="sc">dassl</span> is not very good at
determining a consistent set for you, so it is best if you ensure that
the initial values result in the function evaluating to zero.

        <p>The sixth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of
times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for
avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a
discontinuity in the derivative.

        <p>After a successful computation, the value of <var>istate</var> will be
greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of <span class="sc">dassl</span>).

        <p>If the computation is not successful, the value of <var>istate</var> will be
less than zero and <var>msg</var> will contain additional information.

        <p>You can use the function <code>dasrt_options</code> to set optional
parameters for <code>dasrt</code>.

When called with no arguments, the names of all available options and

must match the dimension of the state vector, and the relative
tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.
