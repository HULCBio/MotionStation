Installation:
Unzip to the same directory structure to which Octave3.6.4_gcc4.6.2.7z was unzipped.
In order to update octave_packages database and auto-load all packages, launch Octave and execute:
    pkg rebuild -auto
Excluding 'ad' which may crash octave when loaded and 'clear all' is executed:
    pkg rebuild -noauto ad
Excluding 'nan' which shadows many statistics functions
    pkg rebuild -noauto nan
Excluding 'gsl' which shadows some core functions
    pkg rebuild -noauto gsl
Rebuild java so it will be loaded first (before io package which then can load its jars):
    pkg rebuild -auto java
