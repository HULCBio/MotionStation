BIRD SIGNALS

The BIRD is controlled via the RS-232C interface located on the rear panel.
The BIRD is configured as Data Communication Equipment (DCE) per the EIA RS-232C
specification.  Table 1 contains a pin description of the BIRD RS232 signals.
(NOTE: as defined in the RS232 specification, a MARK is a negative voltage, -3v
to -25v, and a SPACE is a postive voltage, 3v to 25v).

Notes:
1)    Asserted State of Signal is SPACE (a positive voltage)
2)    Signals are held asserted (SPACE) when the BIRD is in FLY mode and
      deasserted (MARK) when in STDBY mode.  The Bird is in STDBY mode when
      the FLY/STANDBY front panel switch is in STDBY 'OR' when the RTS signal
      isasserted.





When interconnecting the BIRD to a Host computer, a cable must be constructed.
The Host serial port is most commonly configured as Data Terminal Equipment
(DTE).   The BIRD requires that connections be made to the TD, RD and GND signals.  The remaining
signals are used for software and/or hardware flow control and need not be
connected for most applications.



Flow Control

Hardware 

When the BIRD is first turned on, or when the FLY/STDBY front panel switch is
switched from STDBY to FLY mode, the BIRD performs reset operations.  During
the reset period, approximately 1 second, the CTS, DSR, and CD signals are
held deasserted as a MARK.  Upon completion of the reset operations, the CTS,
DSR, and CD signals are set to the asserted state, a SPACE.  The Host should
only send characters to the BIRD when these signals are asserted (only one of
these signal needs to be detected).

When the BIRD is sending characters the Host can suspend transmission by
deasserting the DTR signal (assign DTR to a MARK).  If the RD line is not active,
character transmission will be halted immediately.  If a character is currently
being sent, then transmission will be halted when the character transmission is
complete.  When the DTR line is reasserted, character transmission from the BIRD
will be enabled WITHOUT the loss of any characters.

Software

Transmission from the BIRD can be controlled via the XON (DC3, character 19
decimal) and XOFF (DC1, character 17 decimal) characters.  The XON and XOFF
characters can only be sent when the BIRD is expecting a command character.  In
addition, when the BIRD is in the middle of transmitting a record, the XOFF
character will not be processed until the transmission of the block is complete. 
When in the XOFF state, the XON character will be processed immediately.
